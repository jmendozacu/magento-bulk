Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Being more effective than regular L-Carnitine in that very little dilution of the original concentration occurs when it is administered directly to systemic circulation, it is a bit more on the expensive side given that manufacturing costs are much higher. Due to the association that ALCAR has with the specific acetyl group that it belongs to, it is known for the great variety of benefits it provides to general brain functions and mental health. In fact, Alpha Lipoic Acid, another type of acid found within the body that works in tandem with ALCAR has recently been discovered to have immense benefits when broken down in conjunction with the aforementioned ALCAR. Once again, because of its level of concentration, it is much easier for the system to absorb ALCAR than its base relative, L-Carnitine. It is this very attribute of ALCAR that makes it such an effective type of antioxidant.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>BENEFITS PROVIDED BY Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Once again, one of the major health benefits associated with Acetyl-L-Carnitine is its efficiency in breaking down fatty acids and turning them into a useable energy source to fuel the body. In this sense it helps regulate human metabolism at a basic cellular level. Even though the body regularly produces acceptable amounts of ALCAR all by itself, taking additional supplements can still greatly speed up the speed of this cellular metabolism process, thereby resulting in more energy conserved, less energy wasted.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">During this process of energy production, Carnitines are also known for being able to assist in the removal of waste products from the system\; another reason that these are produced by the liver, an organ which is known for acting as a kind of filter. Generally the body of a healthy person will relegate the kidneys towards managing healthy levels of Carnitines, but bodies afflicted with any sort of kidney disease and in some cases other types of cardiovascular illnesses will result in significantly reduced levels of Carnitines.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>ACETYL-L-CARNITINE AND ALPHA LIPOIC ACID</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">When these two acids are combined, the result is a synergistic effect which allows the mental power and generally everyday brain functions of a person to become much more focused and enhanced. Each of these compounds has properties which assist the brain on their own, but when combined the effect is magnified to even greater proportions. It is because of this that the two are generally found blended together in the various products.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alpha Lipoic Acid is another enzyme which is naturally occurring on its own because it is so important in the process of cellular metabolism. Its usefulness when blended with ALCAR becomes clear in a few different ways. For one, it is able to greatly speed up the transportation of Glucose to muscle tissue resulting in a greater sense of both speed and endurance in the body. Secondly, it allows a greater breadth of fatty acid content to actually be consumed during the metabolizing process so that less weight is gained and more energy is provided to the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">While the powder itself may be a bit off-putting to the taste, here these supplements can be found in proportional amounts contained within capsules so that the slight burning sensation that occurs when the substances hit the tongue need not be endured.</p>;9.16;ALCAR-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/acetyl-l-carnitine-alcar.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_166.jpg;;;<endrecord>

L-Proline Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Though Proline is synthesized by the body, the amount that is actually produced is often not enough. It is mainly found through dietary means in animal products. Vegetarians may need to supplement in order to get the correct amount. Proline also works in tandem with Vitamin C and Lysine to help maintain the integrity of collagen.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Proline may be reduced after exercise, which is why some energy drinks contain trace amounts of the amino acid. </p>;9.16;L-PRO;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-proline.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Goal > Joint & Bone Support;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_4_70.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Vitamin E 1300 IU Oil;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">In fact, the Vitamin E which is found naturally comes in not 1, but 8 different forms which each have their own importance in the body's biological processes. Since of the 8 forms of Vitamin E half are Tocopherols and the other half are Tocotrienols, this product contains large quantities of alpha, delta, and gamma Tocopherols and a few beta.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alpha-Tocopherol is the most effective of these forms in terms of its tendency and ability to be absorbed by the body. It is located throughout the human blood stream and is known for being both the most active type of Vitamin E in the body and also the only naturally occurring kind of Alpha-Tocopherol. There is some research which remarks on the possibility for the effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol to be increased when in the presence of other tocopherols\; however this research has yet to be proven for certain. As far as the comparison between natural and synthetic forms of Tocopherols, the competition isn't even close. Natural Tocopherol beats out synthetic Vitamin E in terms of retention as well as absorption every time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E can be found in many different skin creams because it is known for promoting skin health and elasticity. It can even increase the healing rate when a burn or cut has been sustained if it is applied in a timely manner. Vitamin E does not only protect the skin on the outside though, it also protects it at a deeper cellular level by keeping cell membranes well protected and giving them a defense against oxidation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is absorbed into the blood via the lymph, which in turn takes it from the stomach just as is the case with bile and fats. Once it is in the blood, it can be transferred to the liver to be stored for later use. There the Tocopherols can use the liver as a base to send out agents to prevent free radicals from harming the body. As it is found in various supplements, Vitamin E is actually just Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate which above all, allows it to continue its antioxidant functions despite how it is absorbed and digested.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is a relatively common dietary supplement and is sold as such. It can even be derived naturally from a few different foods. Sometimes it is even present in foods as an additive. It is often prized particularly for its effectiveness as an antioxidant.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Free radicals are merely molecules with unshared electrons. These electrons are known for retaining a high level of energy and react very quickly with Reactive Oxygen Species, which are sometimes referred to as ROS for short. These ROS are formed during the simple metabolic process of transforming food into energy, and it is the job of the antioxidant to protect cells from the harmful effects of ROS. These molecules are also produced in the body as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke air pollution, and high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This type of antioxidant works by stopping the production of ROS that occur when fats are being oxidized. There are a few different chronic diseases that are associated with free radicals and at this moment, scientists are studying whether the ability of Vitamin E to hinder these processes may actually have the capacity to prevent these diseases from occurring in the first place.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is no surprise that Vitamin E also has a connection to immune system fortification given its importance as an antioxidant. However, it also has a link to various other types of metabolic processes including gene expression and cell signaling.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin E Oil 1300 IU/g</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The most important role that Vitamin E has in the body is to keep up the integrity of cellular structure and prevent damage to the skin while also promoting healing of the skin after it has already been damaged. Vitamin E is also revered for its ability to prevent or at least slow down the oxidation process of fats and other types of nutrients.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is not only able to protect the skin, but also provides a protective membrane around the eyes, liver, testes, and breast\; the parts of the body that are most prone to oxidation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One thing that seems to be true for most antioxidants is that they tend to work well with other antioxidants. This means that when taken in conjunction with Vitamin C, Beta-Carotene, etc., the effects of each antioxidant will actually be magnified.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E may have a strong effect on the elasticity of the skin, but it also has this same effect on arterial elasticity.

Potassium Citrate Crystalized Powder;; <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is common to consume anywhere from 2.5 to 5.8 grams of Potassium per day in a typical diet. In general, the amount of Potassium available in supplements is scaled down, since taking too much at once (especially when taken in capsule form) may cause stomach problems. A standard capsule of Potassium supplement will usually have about 100mg of Potassium, whereas a single banana will have about 500mg.

Potassium Iodate Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Iodine is needed in order for the Thyroid glands to function appropriately. These glands control the flow of certain very important hormones throughout the body, and without Iodine, the hormones will be incorrectly produced as Iodine is one of the essential ingredients that goes into these hormones. Far from merely controlling some nondescript hormones, the Thyroid controls metabolism to some extent, aids in the conversion between food and energy, keeps human growth and development in check, and it helps to keep body temperature at normal levels.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Not taking the correct amount of Iodine daily may result in Iodine deficiency which can then result in Hyperthyroidism. This causes the Thyroid to grow and expand in trying to keep up with the body’s demand for hormones. This could cause the development of a goiter that will be very visible on the body. Hyperthyroidism symptoms include a reduction in mental capabilities, depression, fatigue, dry or itchy skin, muscle cramps and pains, leg swelling, and heightened cholesterol levels.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">If this disease continues untreated it may result in puffiness of the eyes, decrease in body temperature, heart rate reduction, general heart issues, and accumulation of fluid in or around the lungs, which can be very dangerous. In its most severe forms, Hyperthyroidism may even lead to a special kind of coma.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">If a woman has Iodine deficiency while pregnant, this may significantly diminish the mental capabilities of the infant once it is born, along with speech problems, problems with movement, stunted growth, and general apathy (which is never a good sign in children). In essence, Iodine deficiency will lead to mental retardation in children. In fact, Iodine deficiency is generally thought to be one of the most common and preventable causes of brain damage. It can even lead to stillbirth and miscarriage if symptoms are severe in the pregnant women. Should this deficiency be corrected, studies have shown that children are more likely to survive.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">A general American diet will have the necessary daily values of Iodine to function well, but in developing countries it has been found that about 30% of the population is subject to Iodine deficiency.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Potassium Iodate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Potassium Iodate is mainly used as a way of supplying the body with much needed Iodine.

L-Arginine a-Ketoglutarate (AAKG) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Arginine is a type of amino acid that does work to maintain the integrity of the skin, joints, liver, and muscles. It also helps in maintaining good levels of blood sugar, hormones, and keeps the immune system functioning well.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because although the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins. Urea is needed in order for the body to expel Ammonia through the urine however\; urea would not be manufactured without Arginine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine is also helpful in releasing insulin when necessary, and in creating and facilitating the creation of important hormones. Arginine helps to stop the restriction of blood flow throughout the body. It allows blood vessels to relax rather than be constricted, dilating them so that there is better flow of oxygen throughout the body.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Arginine AAKG</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Due to its status as an nonessential amino acid, many people do not need to supplement L-Arginine. However, particularly during strenuous exercise cycles, the body is not able to create enough Arginine to sustain this level of activity\; making this an essential element to supplement if you are in any way involved in physical activity or exercise on a regular basis.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are many different foods which contain L-Arginine including soy products, barley, almonds and other nuts\; raisins, types of cereal, meats, oats, and wheat products including flour. These are all major sources of  L-Arginine. There are some conditions which cause people to not be able to accumulate or produce enough Arginine. If you happen to have one such condition, Arginine supplementation is the best alternative for you. Also, those who are interested in maintaining strict levels of exercise should keep up their levels of Arginine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine can be found in high concentrations in the skin. Muscles and connective tissues are also supported by the presence of Arginine in the blood. Creatine and nitrogen supplements are generally taken by body builders and exercise enthusiasts because of their ability to create energy and enhance muscle mass respectively. However, the strength and effectiveness of these supplements is determined by Arginine because without this amino acid, it would be impossible for the body to process these other elements making Arginine just as important for exercise as either of the other two.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Some studies also state that the combination of AKG and Arginine allows the breakdown of muscle tissue to be slowed during exercise. Since muscle is usually the first type of tissue to be burned (due to it having greater mass than fat) this means that taking this supplement may allow you to retain much of your muscle when exercise, even building upon it, while losing fat at the same time.</p>;7.75;L-AAKG-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-arginine-a-ketoglutarate-aakg.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_218.jpg;;;<endrecord>

L-Alanine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Alanine is an amino acid. Amino acids as a group, are very important in all aspects of maintaining the physical body, especially in the building of muscles and in synthesizing proteins.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Generally, Alanine is considered an nonessential acid\; so if you are a healthy person that maintains average health and an average level of physical activity, supplementation and consumption of foods containing Alanine is unnecessary as the body produces enough of its own.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alanine helps to keep the body’s levels of Nitrogen and Glucose balanced. When Glucose is broken down it creates a byproduct known as Pyruvate. When the Alanine cycle occurs, this causes all excess amino acids found in the bodily tissues to be transferred to that Pyruvate receptor molecule. Thus, the Pyruvate molecule is then turned into Alanine and makes its way to the liver. There, the liver extracts a quantity of nitrogen from the Alanine\; converting a portion back into Pyruvate, where the process can then be utilized in the production of Glucose once more. The nitrogen is then used to help the liver perform its natural functions. This cycle continues to perpetuate itself in a healthy body. Alanine is able to use blood sugar as energy, and then give back to that pool of blood sugar through its indirect relation to the production and processing of Glucose as well as other amino acids.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alanine can be found naturally in many different dietary locations including meat, beans, seafood, yeast, brown rice bran, dairy, nuts, corn, gelatin, and other whole grains.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Alanine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alanine is a provider of energy to muscle, the nervous system, and the brain. It helps to support the immune system and it also helps to metabolize acids and sugars that come from organic sources. Since Alanine is essential in the production of energy, this makes it popular to supplement among athletes.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">During exercise routines that are more strenuous, L-Alanine is distributed rapidly throughout the body into areas like the muscles. This makes it perfect to take L-Alanine right before a big workout so that the muscles can be provided with a large source of energy right from the start, allowing the routine to last much longer. </p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alanine keeps toxins from being released during the breakdown of muscles (which occurs every time a real exercise regimen has been going on for some time) so that muscles are free to regrow and repair without having to worry about all of the terrible toxins being released as a result of that muscle building exercise. Alanine is usually derived from diets that have a standard amount of protein in them. However, if for any reason you happen to have a very low protein diet it would be best to take an Alanine supplement. Alanine helps keep levels of blood sugar up even during intense exercise. Since low blood sugar is linked directly to fatigue it is believed that alanine can prevent exercisers from becoming fatigued prematurely.</p> ;7.04;L-ALA-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-alanine.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_171.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Alanine is usually derived from diets that have a standard amount of protein in them. However, if for any reason you happen to have a very low protein diet it would be best to take an Alanine supplement. Alanine helps keep levels of blood sugar up even during intense exercise.

L-Alanine - 5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Alanine is an amino acid. Amino acids as a group, are very important in all aspects of maintaining the physical body, especially in the building of muscles and in synthesizing proteins.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Generally, Alanine is considered an nonessential acid\; so if you are a healthy person that maintains average health and an average level of physical activity, supplementation and consumption of foods containing Alanine is unnecessary as the body produces enough of its own.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alanine helps to keep the body’s levels of Nitrogen and Glucose balanced. When Glucose is broken down it creates a byproduct known as Pyruvate. When the Alanine cycle occurs, this causes all excess amino acids found in the bodily tissues to be transferred to that Pyruvate receptor molecule. Thus, the Pyruvate molecule is then turned into Alanine and makes its way to the liver. There, the liver extracts a quantity of nitrogen from the Alanine\; converting a portion back into Pyruvate, where the process can then be utilized in the production of Glucose once more.

Glycine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Being a nonessential acid not only means that the body is able to manufacture Glycine on its own\; it also implies that the body is able to manufacture enough of it on its own, that little outside supplementation or consumption of Glycine is needed by most people. Glycine can be made directly from the synthesis of Choline that takes place in the kidneys and liver. It also has the ability to be derived from another amino acid called Serine, but can be transformed back into Serine under the right conditions. This process allows the body to detoxify the liver, as well as the manufacture bile to assist the digestive system.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glycine is often taken with Creatine because it boosts the effectiveness of the Creatine. This creates a reaction which builds muscle mass at an accelerated rate while at the same time, continually supplying the body with new energy, storing some of that energy for use later. Glycine can also be found in the skin, in various tissues, and in Collagen, which helps to keep the skin flexible and well rooted to the bones and other tissues. Glycine may also be used as a type of sweetener in some foods because of its somewhat sweet taste.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Glycine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glycine is necessary in reactions that help to form peptides, purines, Adenosine Triphosphate, nucleic acids, bile acids, proteins, Glutathione, Creatine, bile salts, porphyrins, Hemoglobin, Glucose, and other types of amino acids and essential nutrients. There is a hormone known as Glucagon which is able to convert Glycine into Glucose. This hormone can then be used by the body to fulfill certain energy needs. It is Glycine which stimulates this hormone into action in the first place\; allowing the Glucose to be released once the conversion has taken place, which in turn will let that energy flow. The body would not be able to make proper use of the benefits of Glucose without Glycine. Glucose can also be found in high concentrations throughout the spinal cord because it inhibits certain signals, or neurotransmitters.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It doesn’t only inhibit some neurotransmitters, it also helps others which are responsible for cognition and memory in the brain.

Just about every neurotransmitter in the body as well as about 95% of all hormones in the body are made up of amino acids.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Once consumed, the body combines DL-Methionine with ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) where they goes on to produce SAMe. This is a requirement of at least forty different biochemical reactions that are necessary towards sustaining life, and it is also indirectly present in a lot more.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The reason that the body needs Methionine is that it helps produce Cysteine and Taurine\; which help to support the cardiovascular system, build up healthy tissue, and get rid of bad bodily toxins. The body also uses these sulfur compounds to help develop the hair, nails, and skin. Sulfur also aids the kidneys in getting rid of metallic toxins present in there.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Methionine is what is known as a Lipotropic, which means that it helps the liver in rapidly processing fats. Chemicals also a part of the Lipotropic group are Inositol, Betaine, and Choline, which each help out the liver in one way or another. It also helps to support the production of Glutathione, which helps to further detoxify the liver. Methionine is also necessary in the body’s natural production of Creatine, a chemical that is used to build muscle, support the cardiac region, and create new energy and boost overall athletic performance.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by DL-Methionine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Methionine facilitates the body’s protein synthesizing functions, particularly in the case of muscle protein. Methionine also provides the body with much needed sulfur which is necessary for the body to produce energy.

A human being will not be able to survive if these amino acids are not produced and consumed regularly. They are referred to as branch chain amino acids because they have a chemical structure which separates them from the rest of the amino acid family that are also considered essential. In addition, these BCAA's make up 40% of total body protein content and represent around 15 to 25 percent of total protein intake overall.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine is the product of protein hydrolysis by way of various enzymes present in the pancreas. This reaction is part of the overall digestive process and is absolutely necessary in maintaining healthy growth levels in children and infants, as well as keeping regulated nitrogen levels in human adults. Valine is essential in maintaining the structure of various proteins that it has been incorporated into. Isoleucine is again, a chemical used to help stimulate the production and circulation of energy throughout the body. Each of these different amino acids is taken directly into the muscle during the metabolic process which makes them great candidates for muscle building for athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone else that might be routinely involved in strenuous physical activity.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs are found in their greatest natural quantities in products such as red meat and many types of dairy. Protein supplements synthesized from an egg base or from whey are ideal for finding high amounts of BCAA's. Isoleucine alone is found in just about every type of food, but particularly high amounts are usually seen in all types of meats including fish, and various cheeses. Leucine is found in more complex and refined sources of sustenance such as corn, yeast, brown rice, etc. Valine is usually found in flour, soy, mushrooms, peanuts, and meats.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As mentioned before, branch chain amino acids are used as supplements among a large community of athletes and body builder types because of their properties which help improve rates of muscle re-growth and increase general energy production. This means that once the workout is over there are less negative effects afterwards such as excessive tiredness and painful joints and muscles. These BCAAs are particularly important for muscles which are attached to the skeletal structure since they act as their primary source of fuel when they are taxed by long exercise sessions.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs, because of their relation and necessity to exercise are needed in higher quantities than any of the body’s other essential amino acids. They help in the building of muscle because they decrease the speed at which proteins break down while at the same time promoting their synthesis. They enter the body, and after going through the metabolic process, are turned into muscle tissue. Another way in which isoleucine is important to the body is because of its capacity to help maintain blood sugar levels along with energy levels, and in helping the healing process of bones, skin, and muscle tissue all over the body. Any healthy diet must take Isoleucine into account as it is one of the essential amino acids that is not naturally produced within the body. Leucine is essential because this BCAA is what keeps protein synthesis going on at a normal pace. Valine also helps in synthesis of glucose, a process which takes place in the liver and is useful during any time in which anaerobic activity is taking place.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs may reach the pinnacle of importance as far as the life of an athlete is concerned, but they are often sought out by those that desire to maintain generally good health because of their multiple uses and healthy properties. These amino acids are metabolized, not in the liver as with most other amino acids, but in the muscle tissue, making them take instant effect during strenuous exercise, which increases their popularity among athletes. Even the smallest amount of exercise can lower levels of BCAAs, leading to feelings of exhaustion over a short time.

L-Arginine L-Pyroglutamate (APG) - 1kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Arginine is a type of amino acid that does work to maintain the integrity of the skin, joints, liver, and muscles. It also helps in maintaining good levels of blood sugar, hormones, and keeps the immune system functioning well.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because although the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells\; and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins. Urea is needed in order for the body to expel Ammonia through the urine, however, urea would not be manufactured without Arginine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine is also helpful in releasing insulin when necessary and in creating and facilitating the creation of important hormones. Arginine helps to stop the restriction of blood flow throughout the body. It allows blood vessels to relax rather than be constricted, dilating them so that there is better flow of oxygen throughout the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pyroglutamate is another amino acid which can be found in fruit, dairy, meat, and vegetable sources.</p> <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Arginine L-Pyroglutamate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are many different foods which contain L-Arginine including soy products, barley, almonds and other nuts, raisins, types of cereal, meats, oats, and wheat products including flour. These are all major sources of Arginine.  There are some conditions which cause people to not be able to accumulate or produce enough Arginine. If you happen to have one such condition, Arginine supplementation is the best alternative for you. Also, those who are interested in maintaining strict levels of exercise should keep up their levels of Arginine, as it is able to produce a chemical which causes a great increase in the amount of oxygen flowing through to the necessary areas in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine can be found in high concentrations in the skin.

L-Carnitine Base - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Carnitine is actually used as a generic name for several different compounds containing Carnitine. For example, D-Carnitine is the biologically inactive form of Carnitine, while L-Carnitine is the only form that is actually active. Thus, taking D-Carnitine can cause interference with the supplementation of L-Carnitine, which can then cause further problems.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Carnitine is considered conditionally essential, meaning that there are certain conditions a person can undergo which might make supplementation or dietary changes necessary to keep up Carnitine levels. However, on an average day, Carnitine will not need to be supplemented. In order for the body to manufacture Carnitine at acceptable levels, it needs to be fed with good levels of Vitamin B1, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Iron, Methionine, Niacin, and Lysine. All of these must be in order for Carnitine to be created. Carnitine can then go on to make Vitamin C and E more effective. Creatine is not only able to transfer fatty acids into the cells so that they can be converted into energy\; but as it passes through cells, it is able to take toxins out with it and dispose of them, by way of the liver and kidneys. This process makes Creatine an efficient facilitator to the body’s disposal system.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Carnitine is generally found in meats. While fruits and vegetables do have trace amounts, the greatest amount is found in meat.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Usually the body can make its own Carnitine without interruption. However, some may have conditions or deficiencies which cause them to be lacking in sufficient Creatine\; and for these people, supplementation may be necessary. Acetyl-L-Carnitine is available to the public without a prescription.

It is also produced from Arginine in reaction to the activity of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Citrulline is a key component in the urea cycle, the process of producing Ammonia among mammals. It is produced from Carbamoyl Phosphate and Ornithine during major chemical reactions that occur in this process. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">DL-Malic Acid on the other hand, is used as food additive mainly to adjust pH level while inhibiting the growth of bacteria. In the production of tea, Malic Acid is added to bottled tea beverages to achieve a pH level of 4.5 </p>  <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY L-CITRULLINE DL-MALATE 1:1</h2> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Citrulline DL-Malate boosts energy during athletic performance, extreme physical exertion and exercise by removing Ammonia and Lactic Acid from the muscles\; two substances that tend to interfere with efficient muscle activity. Studies made in Europe where this supplement has been used for some 20 years now, suggest that there was a significant reduction in physical and mental fatigue among regular users.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Citrulline DL-Malate speeds up recovery after extreme physical exertion. Taking this supplement can speed up the healing process of tired muscles after extreme physical exertion. It is also important in speeding up healing among the elderly and among patients recovering from surgery and severe trauma. Studies suggest that the removal of Lactic Acid and Ammonia from the muscles significantly improves the healing process and recovery.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Citrulline DL-Malate protects from fatigue and muscle pain. Athletes undergoing training for an upcoming sports event will greatly benefit from supplementation of Citrulline Malate due to its ability to delay the onset of muscle fatigue. </p> ;440.25;L-C-DL-M-11-25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-citrulline-dl-malate.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_140.jpg;;;<endrecord>

L-Glutamine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is by far the most important of all of the amino acids when it comes to metabolism. It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc., into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose\; one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis, as well as in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation. It is sometimes considered fuel for the brain too, as it is one of the few acids with the ability to make it beyond the blood-brain barrier. It can be found in a variety of different foods including legumes, meats and fish, dairy, and various protein powders.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By L-Glutamine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning.

Alpha-ketoglutarate is important in the Krebs cycle. This is the cycle the body goes through which allows various nutrients, proteins, fats, etc to be converted into H2O and carbon dioxide in order to also create usable energy for the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is stored in the muscles and metabolizing organs until the body is in need of energy. Then it is released and converted into glucose when the body needs it. It is also used to keep alkaline levels balanced and to synthesize both RNA and DNA when needed.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine can be found naturally in a variety of meat and dairy related sources such as fish, eggs, and other meats and dairy (and even some plants that are known to have particularly high levels of protein).</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Glutamine AKG</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Much of the energy that glutamine is responsible for creating goes on to power the immune system which would not be nearly as effective without the influence of glutamine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as glutamic acid by the brain. This then acts as a neurotransmitter.

It also works to maintain the Myelin sheath surrounding all nerve cells, which if compromised, would result in serious damage to the central nervous system of an irreparable nature making the connection between muscles and the brain much weaker.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Histidine helps to increase the effectiveness of metabolic processes and also works to produce red and white blood cells. It keeps blood pressure regular and helps get rid of toxins through utilization of the circulatory system. Histidine is a histamine precursor which is released by antibodies when the threat of an allergy occurs.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Histidine acts as a component of quite a few different enzymes which have a direct effect on the function of neurotransmitters.

L-Isoleucine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Foods which have high content of Isoleucine include nuts and seeds, meat, legumes, eggs, peas, soy products, brown rice, and whole wheat among others. Isoleucine in the body is generally found in its highest concentrations in the muscles and it is very important for athletes in particular to have high amounts of it at all times, but particularly right before exercise.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Right after exercise, levels of Isoleucine will be spent and will need to be recovered. However some choose to supplement Isoleucine one hour before exercise so that it will balance out the loss afterwards and it will not take long to regain whatever was lost and reach normal amounts again.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Isoleucine is used mainly to provide muscles with energy as this is where it is usually stored. When you are deficient in Isoleucine the symptoms can range from dizziness and headache to fatigue, irritability, and confusion, and even Depression.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Isoleucine is generally thought of in conjunction with other Branch Chain Amino Acids including Valine and Leucine. When taking Isoleucine supplements it is important to supplement other Branch Chain Amino Acids or this can have an adverse effect on the kidneys and liver. For this reason, Isoleucine should always be taken with two parts Leucine and one part Valine for every one part of Isoleucine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Despite the effects of Isoleucine on its own, for full muscle recovery to take place it is best that all three BCAAs be present in the system. However, Isoleucine is unique from the others in that it alone is able to alter and keep blood sugar at normal levels.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs are generally beneficial when it comes to muscle growth, retention, and repair.

L-Leucine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine is one of the main ways that the body is able to produce energy. This makes it very highly sought after by athletes. The best way to take BCAAs is together\; and for this particular chain, it is best to take two parts Leucine, one part Valine, and one part Isoleucine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine may be found in a variety of sources including meats, cheeses, and wheat and soy flour. The ability for the body to metabolize protein is dependent upon there being a large propensity of Leucine in the body. Body building supplements are routinely stocked with Leucine as its properties allow it to effect exercise performance. It also keeps lean muscle tissue intact during exercise and keeps levels of nitrogen in the body at a balanced level.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs are the most important of all amino acid types because not only do they have an immense effect on the way that muscles are built and broken down, but they also help to maintain the overall working biochemistry of the body. Therefore they combine both effects of the less important amino acids into one, two, or three very important amino acids that all work synergistically.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Leucine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Just like Valine and Isoleucine, L-Leucine is able to repair damaged muscles and keep blood sugar at appropriate levels. It also helps to burn fat and get rid of pervasive fats that are normally hard to get rid of through normal exercise and dieting. This makes Leucine a favorite amongst bodybuilders, power-lifters, and anyone else that is trying to maximize muscle size while minimizing fat. Most BCAAs are able to maximize muscle retention through conversion to glucose. This is the most effective of the other BCAAs because it is converted to glucose faster than others.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine levels are known to decrease with every strenuous exercise regimen. They decrease immediately afterwards and will stay low for some time. To help counteract this process it is a good idea to supplement Leucine one hour before beginning a particularly strenuous exercise routine.</p> ;7.75;L-LEU-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-leucine.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_246.jpg;;;<endrecord>

It also helps to burn fat and get rid of pervasive fats that are normally hard to get rid of through normal exercise and dieting. This makes Leucine a favorite amongst bodybuilders, power-lifters, and anyone else that is trying to maximize muscle size while minimizing fat. Most BCAAs are able to maximize muscle retention through conversion to glucose. This is the most effective of the other BCAAs because it is converted to glucose faster than others.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine levels are known to decrease with every strenuous exercise regimen. They decrease immediately afterwards and will stay low for some time. To help counteract this process it is a good idea to supplement Leucine one hour before beginning a particularly strenuous exercise routine.</p> ;84.07;L-LEU-5KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-leucine.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_244.jpg;;;<endrecord>
L-Leucine - 25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine is one of the main ways that the body is able to produce energy. This makes it very highly sought after by athletes. The best way to take BCAAs is together\; and for this particular chain, it is best to take two parts Leucine, one part Valine, and one part Isoleucine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine may be found in a variety of sources including meats, cheeses, and wheat and soy flour. The ability for the body to metabolize protein is dependent upon there being a large propensity of Leucine in the body. Body building supplements are routinely stocked with Leucine as its properties allow it to effect exercise performance.

L-Ornithine a-ketoglutarate OKG - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">OKG eventually results in the production of Arginine which can make the pituitary gland release growth hormone to help the body grow naturally and normally. However, it also helps muscles grow in already fully grown adults and it also helps to get rid of excess Ammonia. This is important because it is Ammonia that usually leads to so much fatigue and soreness of the muscles.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking Glutamine along with OKG can help even further reduce recovery time so that muscles need not be in pain days after exercise. It can help them heal and feel less sore very soon after exercise. Glutamine is also necessary in its own right for its role in the Krebs Cycle and restoring energy to the body when in need of it after and during exercise. Ornithine may be found in high levels in meat and dairy products.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">OKG is helpful in increasing protein synthesis and in lowering the catabolism of protein. It also helps Glucose be more easily absorbed into the muscles for immediate use as well as other amino acids and it even increases the production and rate of excretion of the chemicals insulin and somatropin.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Not only does OKG help to expel Ammonia once it is taken, but while it is in the system it slows the accumulation of Ammonia meaning that your body does not take in as much while it is in the body. This is due to the fact that Glutamine is retained so easily from the other properties of OKG. OKG is good for athletes that want to increase endurance and increase exercise time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">On a less exercise related note, Ornithine is also helpful in maintaining healthy hair and is needed in order for Citrulline, Glutamic acids, and Proline to be produced at normal rates.

L-Valine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Valine is important in keeping nitrogen balance in check and is also needed for the development of the muscles. It is considered an essential amino acid because the body cannot provide significant enough amounts on its own. It must be found through supplementation or other dietary means.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Valine and other BCAAs are usually processed in the liver. They go through the metabolic process in the muscles and thus, they influence the way that muscles recover after intense exercise.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Valine is important for lowering the speed of muscle breakdown during exercise and for increasing the rate of glucose production. It also helps Tryptophan, Phenylalanine, and Tyrosine become more easily transmitted to and from the brain.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Like other BCAAs when it is being processed in the liver it also possesses the ability to help the liver remove harmful toxins and it is also able to use the nitrogen created there to transport it to other areas of the body to help remove toxins there as well.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Athletes who are constantly exercising and those that have restricted themselves to low protein diets should consider supplementation of Valine because their levels will generally be lower due to their lifestyle. When taking this supplement it is best to take it with two parts Leucine and one part Isoleucine to every part of Valine in order to make sure amino acid content in the body stays balanced.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Many natural food sources also contain high Valine content though.

L-Valine - 25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Valine is important in keeping nitrogen balance in check and is also needed for the development of the muscles. It is considered an essential amino acid because the body cannot provide significant enough amounts on its own. It must be found through supplementation or other dietary means.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Valine and other BCAAs are usually processed in the liver. They go through the metabolic process in the muscles and thus, they influence the way that muscles recover after intense exercise.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Valine is important for lowering the speed of muscle breakdown during exercise and for increasing the rate of glucose production. It also helps Tryptophan, Phenylalanine, and Tyrosine become more easily transmitted to and from the brain.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Like other BCAAs when it is being processed in the liver it also possesses the ability to help the liver remove harmful toxins and it is also able to use the nitrogen created there to transport it to other areas of the body to help remove toxins there as well.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Athletes who are constantly exercising and those that have restricted themselves to low protein diets should consider supplementation of Valine because their levels will generally be lower due to their lifestyle. When taking this supplement it is best to take it with two parts Leucine and one part Isoleucine to every part of Valine in order to make sure amino acid content in the body stays balanced.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Many natural food sources also contain high Valine content though. These include green leafy veggies, meats, soy protein, beans, milk, peanuts, and mushrooms.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Valine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">In order for muscles to metabolize correctly, Valine is needed.

N-Acetyl L-Carnosine - 10g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">N-Acetyl L-Carnosine (NAC) also has antioxidant properties which keep healthy cells protected from the damage that could be done by harmful free radicals. NAC is particularly useful in the eye lenses as it stops the Peroxidation and Glycosylation of lipids.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">For those that are not familiar with what this means, oxidation is the name given to the metabolism of Oxygen. The metabolism of Oxygen is what eventually leads to the accidental formation of free radicals, which in turn go on to harm the body. Therefore, NAC is instrumental in the indirect prevention of free radical damage.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The name Glycosylation is given to the process involving protein oxidation via sugar. While the technical details of this are fairly complicated, the end result is a reduction in cell functionality and the overall possibility of cell death.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is very important not to confuse N-Acetyl L-Carnosine with either Acetyl L-Carnosine or L-Carnitine. This is because the latter two are amino acids which are completely different from N-Acetyl L-Carnosine and do not have nearly the same effects as N-Acetyl L-Carnosine.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by N-Acetyl L-Carnosine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">N-Acetyl L-Carnosine is an amino acid that possesses the properties of a strong antioxidant which protects against free radicals.

While Tyrosine may be considered nonessential and does not need to be supplemented through diet, this does not mean that it can’t be found through dietary means. On the contrary, there are many dietary sources that Tyrosine may be derived from such as almonds, pumpkin seeds, many different types of dairy, bananas, Lima beans, and sesame seeds.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine (NALT)</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">NALT is a precursor to the very important neurotransmitters, Dopamine and Norepinephrine.

Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking into account the wide spectrum of the most common kinds of nutrients, Vitamin C always seems to be the most popular. When it is ingested, it instantly goes to work circulating through all of the watery areas of the human body (once it has been absorbed into the intestines, of course) and from there, helps in the fortification of Collagen while acting as an antioxidant during the trip. Vitamin C is routinely used as a food additive along with other kinds of antioxidants like Calcium salts, Sodium, and Potassium. It is for this reason that the traditional Vitamin C supplements that can be bought in stores contain not only Ascorbic Acid, but many other types of Ascorbates that fit a similar purpose.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C also has a host of other general uses. It assists in the repair of damaged tissue, in keeping up healthy levels of Collagen\; and in conjunction with equally essential insoluble compounds, such as Vitamin E. Vitamin C helps these become generally more effective at what they already accomplish for the body.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>IS THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE VITAMIN C THE BIOACTIVE FORM L-ASCORBIC ACID?</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">There has been some concern due to shady business tactics from a variety of companies that the generally available forms of Vitamin C may not be as active as would generally be desired. Well, you should feel relieved to know that this is no longer a practice that is followed by any company. Worldwide, the stock of Vitamin C on all store shelves is the bioactive form L-Ascorbic Acid.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY ASCORBIC ACID POWDER</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C is most well known for its usefulness in conjunction with other enzymes and solutions. This widens the usefulness of Vitamin C considerably more from its already essential position. It is a necessary ingredient in the building of tissue, in the protection and fortification of the immune system, in Collagen strengthening, in the synthesizing of Carnitine (which is the first step in the process of cellular metabolism), and in helping to maintain bone and teeth structure. It also helps convert Tetrahydrofolic acid from Folacin.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Of course it should go without saying at this point that Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant. Much like Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), Vitamin C is also useful in the neutralization of harmful free radical molecules, and it also helps to police any threatening activity that may be occurring in any of the watery parts of the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Not only does Vitamin C help in the fortification of Collagen, it is actually an essential building block of this type of protein tissue. Collagen can be found throughout all parts of the body and it is what controls our body’s level of flexibility to an extent, while also strengthening blood vessels, teeth, gums, cartilage, vertebrae, etc. Vitamin C is even essential in healing minor wounds and cuts through its Collagen production.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C is an immune system stimulant and modulator.

N-Acetyl L-Glutamine - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is by far the most important of all of the amino acids when it comes to metabolism. It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose, one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis and in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation. It is sometimes considered fuel for the brain too, as it is one of the few acids with the ability to make it beyond the blood-brain barrier. It can be found in a variety of different foods including legumes, meats and fish, dairy, and various protein powders.</p> <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By N-Acetyl L-Glutamine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as Glutamic Acid by the brain.

N-Acetyl L-Glutamine - 25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is by far the most important of all of the amino acids when it comes to metabolism. It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose, one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis and in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation. It is sometimes considered fuel for the brain too, as it is one of the few acids with the ability to make it beyond the blood-brain barrier. It can be found in a variety of different foods including legumes, meats and fish, dairy, and various protein powders.</p> <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By N-Acetyl L-Glutamine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as Glutamic Acid by the brain.

Beta Carotene 1% (Provitamin A) - 25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Beta-Carotene is transformed into Vitamin A as it makes its way gradually through the intestines and liver, making it classified as a provitamin. The popular reason for eating carrots for good eyesight, as cited by numerous mothers and grandmothers is not incorrect either\; as Vitamin A, also known as Retinol, is known for promoting good eyesight as well as general good health. Unfortunately, it can be toxic if it is taken in doses that are too large. Luckily, Beta-Carotene is not converted into Vitamin A by the body at a fast enough rate to reach highly toxic levels. It is for this reason that Beta-Carotene is generally preferred as a method of Vitamin A supplementation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The highest concentrations of Beta-Carotene may be found in carrots of course, as well as fruits such as cantaloupe, tomatoes, etc. It is also present in dark greens such as broccoli and squash. Sweet potatoes are a rich source of it as well. The darker the pigmentation of a plant, especially an orange one, the more Beta-Carotene it is likely to contain since pigmentation in plants is so dependent on Carotenoids such as Beta-Carotene. Beta-Carotene only has about one twelfth the potency of pure Vitamin A.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Beta-Carotene 1%</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Beta-Carotene is the precursor for Vitamin A, it helps in all of the processes that Vitamin A helps in. It can be used to effectively treat deficiency of Vitamin A. Beta-Carotene assists in protection of the eyes by manufacturing Retinol, which is an ingredient necessary for good eye health.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">On a more indirect note, diets that are low in fat but high in fruit and vegetable content, can reduce the risk of developing some kinds of cancer. In other words, diets rich in Vitamin A while low in fats will lower your chances of getting certain types of cancer.</p>;2984.37;BC-25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/beta-carotene-1-provitamin-a.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Vitamins;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_270.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Calcium Ascorbate (Vitamin C) - 100g Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Calcium Ascorbate Buffered Vitamin C</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Calcium Ascorbate buffered Vitamin C is the product of combining Vitamin C with Calcium, and thus the beneficial effects of both substances come through in the end. This works because the Calcium Ascorbate solution is separated in the stomach\; the acid is separated from the calcium, yielding ascorbic acid and pure calcium respectively. In addition, the Ascorbic Acid actually facilitates the process of Calcium being absorbed into cells making the Calcium that much more efficiently received. On top of that, Ascorbic Acid also assists in more efficient absorption of iron, and in providing the body with essential antioxidants to boost the performance of the immune system. This is done by neutralizing free radicals (molecules that damage healthy cells and come about as a byproduct of metabolizing food into energy) and stopping harmful reactions that take place in water dense parts of the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C assists in producing Collagen, which is a protein that is necessary for providing flexibility to all sorts of bodily structures like muscles, sinews and blood vessels. On top of that, it also keeps bone marrow, bones, cartilage, discs of the vertebrae, teeth, and skin all at healthy levels. In accelerating the production of Collagen, this means that Vitamin C is an essential part of the body’s healing process. Without Vitamin C it would be significantly more difficult for clots to form and thus, stifle blood from flowing excessively out of cuts and abrasions.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Aside from neutralizing free radicals, there are other ways that Vitamin C is important for sustaining the success of the immune system. It helps in the production of interferon, helps leukocytes work more efficiently, and helps to maintain the integrity of the body’s various mucous membranes to ward off infection.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are four enzymes that are necessary for humans to successfully produce Ascorbic Acid on their own, and unfortunately humans only possess three of the four.

Choline DL-Bitartrate - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is actually a fairly basic lecithin found in many different food products, especially organs, beans, wheat germ, eggs, peanuts, and other dairy. Meats are the best sources of it because the highest concentrations of Choline are typically found in the fat portions of the cell membranes, meaning foods with higher fat content are more likely to have higher amounts of Choline. Choline is thought to be useful in muscle contraction, and general good coordination skills.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is useful in a variety of other ways too, such as cell communications, stabilizing the correct functions of muscles, regulation of impulse transmission through the nervous system, and in the production of Acetylcholine, which is known to influence state of mind, eating habits, and general behavior. Finally, Choline can also act as an antioxidant to some extent, protecting healthy cells from harmful free radicals.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Choline Bitartrate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is a nutrient necessary for the body in order to keep up the emulsification of fats and cholesterol, and to facilitate the movement of hormones to the correct areas of the body. It is necessary for proper functioning of the nervous system, the liver, and the gallbladder.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Even though it is not actually a B vitamin, it is sometimes considered to be a part of this complex because it operates in conjunction with various types of B vitamins to maintain adequate levels of health in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline Bitartrate is indirectly involved in the conversion of fat into energy and nutrients, speeds up their mobilization throughout the body, and also aids in the production of HDL, a helpful type of cholesterol. Choline also assists in the formation of Betaine, which is a methyl donor of no small importance.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is especially important in establishing endurance when it comes to physical exercise.

Choline DL-Bitartrate - 250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is actually a fairly basic lecithin found in many different food products, especially organs, beans, wheat germ, eggs, peanuts, and other dairy. Meats are the best sources of it because the highest concentrations of Choline are typically found in the fat portions of the cell membranes, meaning foods with higher fat content are more likely to have higher amounts of Choline. Choline is thought to be useful in muscle contraction, and general good coordination skills.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is useful in a variety of other ways too, such as cell communications, stabilizing the correct functions of muscles, regulation of impulse transmission through the nervous system, and in the production of Acetylcholine, which is known to influence state of mind, eating habits, and general behavior. Finally, Choline can also act as an antioxidant to some extent, protecting healthy cells from harmful free radicals.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Choline Bitartrate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is a nutrient necessary for the body in order to keep up the emulsification of fats and cholesterol, and to facilitate the movement of hormones to the correct areas of the body. It is necessary for proper functioning of the nervous system, the liver, and the gallbladder.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Even though it is not actually a B vitamin, it is sometimes considered to be a part of this complex because it operates in conjunction with various types of B vitamins to maintain adequate levels of health in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline Bitartrate is indirectly involved in the conversion of fat into energy and nutrients, speeds up their mobilization throughout the body, and also aids in the production of HDL, a helpful type of cholesterol. Choline also assists in the formation of Betaine, which is a methyl donor of no small importance.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is especially important in establishing endurance when it comes to physical exercise.

Coenzyme Q10 (COQ10) - 10g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Coenzyme Q10 is specifically responsible for synthesizing Adenosine Triphosphate, a molecule which acts as the major energy source for each individual cell. It does this by jump starting many different biological processes including increased rate of protein production as well as muscle contraction. It is this Adenosine Triphosphate, coming from Coenzyme Q10, which is directly responsible for acting as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzyme complexes, thus creating energy for the cell.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Oddly enough, reindeer is one of the largest sources of Coenzyme Q10 with other meat products such as oily fish and pork coming up behind it.

Past age thirty though, the amount of Coenzyme Q10 in the body begins a sharp decline which causes the body to be more susceptible to damage from these harmful molecules. Coenzyme Q10 works an immune system strengthener, and as a coenzyme for various other types of enzymes which provide many different services for the body at a cellular level.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Unlike other supplements, Coenzyme Q10 can actually be taken both as a dietary supplement and also as a topical rub in order for the intended effects to be experienced.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Without Coenzyme Q10, the mitochondria in each cell would find it very difficult to correctly or efficiently process cholesterol and fat. It also provides the helpful service of increasing levels of blood and oxygen to be used by the heart.

It does this by jump starting many different biological processes including increased rate of protein production as well as muscle contraction. It is this Adenosine Triphosphate, coming from Coenzyme Q10, which is directly responsible for acting as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzyme complexes, thus creating energy for the cell.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Oddly enough, reindeer is one of the largest sources of Coenzyme Q10 with other meat products such as oily fish and pork coming up behind it. As few as one hundred different foods can provide Coenzyme Q10, however the ones that are found in most common diets contain far less than what would constitute a proper single serving of Coenzyme Q10.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Coenzyme Q10</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">In addition to acting indirectly as an energy source for every cell in the body, it also can provide services as an antioxidant in neutralizing harmful free radicals. Past age thirty though, the amount of Coenzyme Q10 in the body begins a sharp decline which causes the body to be more susceptible to damage from these harmful molecules. Coenzyme Q10 works an immune system strengthener, and as a coenzyme for various other types of enzymes which provide many different services for the body at a cellular level.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Unlike other supplements, Coenzyme Q10 can actually be taken both as a dietary supplement and also as a topical rub in order for the intended effects to be experienced.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Without Coenzyme Q10, the mitochondria in each cell would find it very difficult to correctly or efficiently process cholesterol and fat. It also provides the helpful service of increasing levels of blood and oxygen to be used by the heart.

N,N, Dimethyl Glycine Anhydrous - 5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Dimethyl Glycine (DMG) is a nutrient which can be found in many different foods, with particularly high concentrations existing in legumes and grains. It can also be manufactured by the body to a small degree. Taken as a supplement, DMG is able to facilitate the creation of many different chemicals through enzymatic reactions, including but not limited to Choline, Methionine, and other important neurotransmitters. The substance known as Betaine that DMG is so often compared to is essentially actually just a Glycine which has been attached to three different methyl groups. This separates it from Dimethyl Glycine by only one methyl group.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Since DMG is so closely related to Glycine, it is also an important component in the production of energy for the body. It can assist in the exercise process by easing the pain felt by straining muscles and in reducing fatigue felt after particularly draining exercise. Glycine is considered nonessential, but is very important in the formation of various muscle tissues and it also helps with the maintenance of the digestive and nervous systems, keeping them in working order.

It can also be manufactured by the body to a small degree. Taken as a supplement, DMG is able to facilitate the creation of many different chemicals through enzymatic reactions, including but not limited to Choline, Methionine, and other important neurotransmitters. The substance known as Betaine that DMG is so often compared to is essentially actually just a Glycine which has been attached to three different methyl groups. This separates it from Dimethyl Glycine by only one methyl group.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Since DMG is so closely related to Glycine, it is also an important component in the production of energy for the body. It can assist in the exercise process by easing the pain felt by straining muscles and in reducing fatigue felt after particularly draining exercise. Glycine is considered nonessential, but is very important in the formation of various muscle tissues and it also helps with the maintenance of the digestive and nervous systems, keeping them in working order.

Pine Bark Extract - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">There are many antioxidants out there that perform the same actions as Pine Bark Extract with varying degrees of success. Some of this extract’s peers include Vitamins A, C, and E as well as Selenium. However, the OPCs (Oligomeric Proanthocyanodins, the scientific name for the specific type of antioxidants found in Pine Bark) present in Pine Bark Extract are some of the most potent forms of antioxidants that can be found in nature.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Another rich source of OPC's is in the extract of the Grape Seed, which are more widely used than even Pine Bark Extract. Even though OPC's are present in both extracts, these are two distinct substances and share more differences than they do commonalities.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pine Bark Extract is not only used as an antioxidant. It also has properties which allow it to repair Collagen tissue, a type of protein which is the main component that forms blood vessels, connective tissue and skin.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pine Bark Extract is more effective as an antioxidant than even Vitamin C and E, the two vitamins generally used for their properties as antioxidants.

R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (R-ALA) - 10g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">In order to get things straight, it is important to note that the taxonomic chasm separating R-ALA from RS-ALA is a wide one. R-ALA is a more expensive alternative because it can be absorbed by the body much more easily than RS-ALA, and is also much more difficult to manufacture. Most ALA that is manufactured comes in the form of RS-ALA, with R-ALA taking up a much smaller percentage of production rates.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">R-ALA can be found in various levels of availability in all organs and muscles within the human body and is fat soluble. After ALA is taken in the form of a supplement or enough is ingested via food, it enters the blood stream effortlessly, and is able to circulate through the brain as well. It is useful, when taken in conjunction with vitamin supplements such as Vitamin C and E, in the protection of cells and in expelling waste or other harmful materials out of the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking this into account, ALA also assists in recycling various other antioxidants such as Glutathione, the aforementioned Vitamins C, and E, and it even renews itself to an extent which has lead to its colorful nickname, “The universal antioxidant.” ALA helps speed up the process of creating energy from various proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutathione, another important antioxidant that helps in the protection of the cellular structure, in preserving the effectiveness of the immune system, and in the detoxification of the liver, is increased in production levels by ALA. This is the only antioxidant that is known to have this effect on Glutathione levels. It is broken down before it has reached the cells, in the digestive tract, making ALA’s ability to boost the levels of Glutathione quite important.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Alpha Lipoic Acid</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The Krebs cycle is the body’s process for turning sugars and carbohydrates into usable energy, and ALA is also instrumental in facilitating this process. Free radicals, molecules that have gone out of control and can cause damage to other cells while they circulate throughout the body, are neutralized by the healing power of ALA.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">ALA is also known for helping in the regulation of levels of cholesterol, which in turn contributes to an overall feeling of well-being. ALA is also especially helpful for athletes because it’s free-radical-neutralizing properties helps in speeding up muscle recovery, which means longer exercising sessions and less pain felt during exercise. It is also useful in speeding up metabolism, and in delivering necessary nutrients as well as carbohydrates.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl-L-Carnitine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Acetyl-L-Carnitine, or ALCAR is another form of antioxidant which is naturally produced by the body. In conjunction with ALA, it is known to help to speed up brain functions and heighten mental acuity. For this reason they are usually found to be blended together in products. ALCAR and ALA together can help speed up the transfer of glucose to muscle greatly, and this blend can also help to increase the utilization of fatty acids and energy production at a cellular level.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">These compounds come combined together in capsules at a level of 175mg of ALA and 425mg ALCAR respectively. Because the taste of ALA can be abrasive to the tongue, these products are generally found together in capsule form alone.</p>      ;13.40;R-ALA-10;http://www.bulksupplements.com/alpha-lipoic-acid-r-ala.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_263.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Vitamin E Powder 700IU - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">In fact, the Vitamin E which is found naturally comes in not 1, but 8 different forms which each have their own importance in the body's biological processes. Since of the 8 forms of Vitamin E half are Tocopherols and the other half are Tocotrienols, this product contains large quantities of alpha, delta, and gamma Tocopherols and a few beta.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alpha-Tocopherol is the most effective of these forms in terms of its tendency and ability to be absorbed by the body. It is located throughout the human blood stream and is known for being both the most active type of Vitamin E in the body and also the only naturally occurring kind of Alpha-Tocopherol. There is some research which remarks on the possibility for the effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol to be increased when in the presence of other Tocopherols\; however this research has yet to be proven for certain. As far as the comparison between natural and synthetic forms of Tocopherols, the competition isn't even close. Natural Tocopherol beats out synthetic Vitamin E in terms of retention as well as absorption every time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E can be found in many different skin creams because it is known for promoting skin health and elasticity. It can even increase the healing rate when a burn or cut has been sustained if it is applied in a timely manner. Vitamin E does not only protect the skin on the outside though, it also protects it at a deeper cellular level by keeping cell membranes well protected and giving them a defense against oxidation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is absorbed into the blood via the lymph, which in turn takes it from the stomach just as is the case with bile and fats. Once it is in the blood, it can be transferred to the liver to be stored for later use. There the Tocopherols can use the liver as a base to send out agents to prevent free radicals from harming the body. As it is found in various supplements, Vitamin E is actually just Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate which above all, allows it to continue its antioxidant functions despite how it is absorbed and digested.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is a relatively common dietary supplement and is sold as such. It can even be derived naturally from a few different foods. Sometimes it is even present in foods as an additive. It is often prized particularly for its effectiveness as an antioxidant.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Free radicals are merely molecules with unshared electrons. These electrons are known for retaining a high level of energy and react very quickly with Reactive Oxygen Species, which are sometimes referred to as ROS for short. These ROS are formed during the simple metabolic process of transforming food into energy, and it is the job of the antioxidant to protect cells from the harmful effects of ROS. These molecules are also produced in the body as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke air pollution, and high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This type of antioxidant works by stopping the production of ROS that occur when fats are being oxidized. There are a few different chronic diseases that are associated with free radicals and at this moment, scientists are studying whether the ability of Vitamin E to hinder these processes may actually have the capacity to prevent these diseases from occurring in the first place.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is no surprise that Vitamin E also has a connection to immune system fortification given its importance as an antioxidant. However, it also has a link to various other types of metabolic processes including gene expression and cell signaling.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin E Powder 700 IU</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The most important role that Vitamin E has in the body is to keep up the integrity of cellular structure and prevent damage to the skin while also promoting healing of the skin after it has already been damaged. Vitamin E is also revered for its ability to prevent or at least slow down the oxidation process of fats and other types of nutrients.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is not only able to protect the skin but also provides a protective membrane around the eyes, liver, testes, and breast\; the parts of the body that are most prone to oxidation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One thing that seems to be true for most antioxidants is that they tend to work well with other antioxidants. This means that when taken in conjunction with Vitamin C, Beta-Carotene, etc., the effects of each antioxidant will actually be magnified.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E may have a strong effect on the elasticity of the skin, but it also has this same effect on arterial elasticity. This means that blood can flow, free of obstruction, and keep the arteries from being clogged.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One particularly threatening aspect of oxidation is its potential to deconstruct and damage DNA, but this troubling aspect can be prevented when Vitamin E is present.</p>;17.64;VEP-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/vitamin-e-powder-700iu.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Vitamins;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_2_84.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Vitamin E Powder 700IU - 5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">In fact, the Vitamin E which is found naturally comes in not 1, but 8 different forms which each have their own importance in the body's biological processes. Since of the 8 forms of Vitamin E half are Tocopherols and the other half are Tocotrienols, this product contains large quantities of alpha, delta, and gamma Tocopherols and a few beta.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alpha-Tocopherol is the most effective of these forms in terms of its tendency and ability to be absorbed by the body. It is located throughout the human blood stream and is known for being both the most active type of Vitamin E in the body and also the only naturally occurring kind of Alpha-Tocopherol. There is some research which remarks on the possibility for the effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol to be increased when in the presence of other Tocopherols\; however this research has yet to be proven for certain. As far as the comparison between natural and synthetic forms of Tocopherols, the competition isn't even close. Natural Tocopherol beats out synthetic Vitamin E in terms of retention as well as absorption every time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E can be found in many different skin creams because it is known for promoting skin health and elasticity. It can even increase the healing rate when a burn or cut has been sustained if it is applied in a timely manner. Vitamin E does not only protect the skin on the outside though, it also protects it at a deeper cellular level by keeping cell membranes well protected and giving them a defense against oxidation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is absorbed into the blood via the lymph, which in turn takes it from the stomach just as is the case with bile and fats. Once it is in the blood, it can be transferred to the liver to be stored for later use. There the Tocopherols can use the liver as a base to send out agents to prevent free radicals from harming the body. As it is found in various supplements, Vitamin E is actually just Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate which above all, allows it to continue its antioxidant functions despite how it is absorbed and digested.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin E is a relatively common dietary supplement and is sold as such. It can even be derived naturally from a few different foods. Sometimes it is even present in foods as an additive. It is often prized particularly for its effectiveness as an antioxidant.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Free radicals are merely molecules with unshared electrons. These electrons are known for retaining a high level of energy and react very quickly with Reactive Oxygen Species, which are sometimes referred to as ROS for short. These ROS are formed during the simple metabolic process of transforming food into energy, and it is the job of the antioxidant to protect cells from the harmful effects of ROS.

Zinc Gluconate - 250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Zinc supplements are traditionally used as a treatment for Zinc deficiency and also to keep subjects on a path towards normal growth if there are any hormone imbalances preventing someone from developing properly. Those that have below average levels of Zinc will have negative symptoms such as poor night vision, slower healing after sustaining wounds, a reduction in the senses of both smell and taste, and a lack of development in the reproductive organs (if the person is younger or still developing). Reduction of Zinc levels in children can stunt growth, cause greater receptiveness to infection and disease, and inhibit sexual growth. There are around 800,000 deaths per year reported where zinc deficiency was either a direct or indirect cause.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">In fact, Zinc deficiency is credited with being the fifth highest risk factor id disease development.

Chlorella Blue-Green Algae - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">While this type of algae grows naturally in all kinds of fresh water sources, the kind that is used by humans is cultivated in large pools and is exposed to large amounts of direct sunlight, clean water, and fresh air so as to make it as healthy and beneficial as possible. Special equipment is required to harvest these algae due to their small size. This plant reproduces once every twenty hours allowing it to spread rapidly.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This algae is believed to be about 2 billion years old, and was one of the first plants to have anything that could be called a defined nucleus in its cellular structure. Despite how prevalent it is, it was not actually discovered until the 19th century. It was late in the 1800’s when it was discovered by the Dutch. After its discovery, it was researched for possible use as a source of protein. Though it was regarded as a possible food source and had sufficient nutritional properties, cultivating it in order to feed the masses after the food shortage and population boom, which took place shortly after the end of WWII, was determined to be uneconomic overall. Though these pursuits were abandoned, it was still cultivated for other specific uses, and more research resulted in more uses being discovered for this algae.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Chlorella are small enough to be considered microorganisms, and each individual microorganism contains the basic structure of a cell, including a nucleus, mitochondria, cell walls made up of cellulose for protection and to hold these components together along with starch grains and chloroplasts which are present in the cellular structure of most plants.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Why is Chlorella Algae Powder Popular Today?</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Popularity of Chlorella Algae still endures despite how old and difficult to cultivate it is. Why is this? This has to do with the adaptive history of Chlorella Algae. Because it is a freshwater plant, it had to adapt to survive periodic droughts that were very much a reality in the erratic weather patterns of the past 2 billion years. Therefore, it developed a fibrous shell around it which had two different important characteristics. It first allowed the cellular structure of the algae to be maintained as long as possible until the algae had been dried out beyond all hope. Secondly, and most importantly, this shell was used to absorb nutrients in the surrounding water to keep feeding the cell for as long as possible. This happened until the water was totally gone so that when the water returns, it is able to easily bounce back to full recovery.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is this property that makes Chlorella Algae so useful to humans. This particular powder is called 'Chlorella Algae Broken Cell' because the outer shell has been cracked. This allows the nutrients within the algae to be more effectively absorbed while still providing the same benefits of the outer shell to the human body and digestive tract.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Chlorella Blue-Green Algae</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the most prominent health benefits of Chlorella Algae lies in its ability to detoxify the digestive tract. The outer shell of the Chlorella absorbs all of the toxic agents that are present in the digestive tract and detoxifies the intestines as it passes through. Not only that, but the insides of the algae are chock full of nutrients including Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Folic acid, Vitamin B2, Manganese, and Iodine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Chlorella Algae helps to open up the arteries, increasing blood flow, and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen that makes it to muscle tissue and all of the important areas. It also synthesizes red blood cells to stimulate creation of new blood and the production of microscopic plant cultures within the intestine. These will continue to produce similar effects to Chlorella Algae without having to take the supplement all the time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The question about the difference between Chlorella Algae and Spirulina Algae is often brought up since the two are very similar. The biggest difference is that Chlorella Algae have higher Iron content than Spirulina which can be a benefit or a drawback depending on the individual needs of the person taking it. Pregnant women often need to have higher Iron intake to make up for the amount being taken by their child. Older men also need more Iron in their diet to strengthen their bones. However, taking too much Iron can cause oxidation which puts greater pressure on the immune system to neutralize free radicals.

Why is this? This has to do with the adaptive history of Chlorella Algae. Because it is a freshwater plant, it had to adapt to survive periodic droughts that were very much a reality in the erratic weather patterns of the past 2 billion years. Therefore, it developed a fibrous shell around it which had two different important characteristics. It first allowed the cellular structure of the algae to be maintained as long as possible until the algae had been dried out beyond all hope. Secondly, and most importantly, this shell was used to absorb nutrients in the surrounding water to keep feeding the cell for as long as possible. This happened until the water was totally gone so that when the water returns, it is able to easily bounce back to full recovery.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is this property that makes Chlorella Algae so useful to humans.

The outer shell of the Chlorella absorbs all of the toxic agents that are present in the digestive tract and detoxifies the intestines as it passes through. Not only that, but the insides of the algae are chock full of nutrients including Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Folic acid, Vitamin B2, Manganese, and Iodine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Chlorella Algae helps to open up the arteries, increasing blood flow, and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen that makes it to muscle tissue and all of the important areas. It also synthesizes red blood cells to stimulate creation of new blood and the production of microscopic plant cultures within the intestine. These will continue to produce similar effects to Chlorella Algae without having to take the supplement all the time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The question about the difference between Chlorella Algae and Spirulina Algae is often brought up since the two are very similar. The biggest difference is that Chlorella Algae have higher Iron content than Spirulina which can be a benefit or a drawback depending on the individual needs of the person taking it. Pregnant women often need to have higher Iron intake to make up for the amount being taken by their child. Older men also need more Iron in their diet to strengthen their bones. However, taking too much Iron can cause oxidation which puts greater pressure on the immune system to neutralize free radicals.

Copper deficiency can lead to a whole host of issues. There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as a mode of delivery for Copper, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Aspartate, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few. Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels, as Copper and Zinc can compete for bodily absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The Gluconic Acid present in this mixture is not corrosive. It has mild effects and is organically derived from sources like fruit, kombucha, wine, and honey.

This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">This is one of the reasons that Aspartic Acid is included in this solution because it helps to increase the rate of absorption by the body and makes the system’s usage of copper much more efficient. The Citric Acid cycle which is the key to producing energy within each individual cell is also fueled by Aspartic Acid to some degree.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Aspartic Acid is a requirement in every cell in the body for this very reason. It does this by promoting the efficient transfer of electrolytes and minerals between the digestive tract and each cell individually. It can also reduce the oxygen consumption of cells during the metabolic process which allows less energy to be expended in the creation of new energy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Copper Aspartate is a nutritional analog, which means that though it is the product of synthesis, it has been tested to perform its duties as a nutritional supplement at an even higher level of effectiveness than the two or more original elements it was synthesized from.

Vitamin A Palmitate - 50g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin A is normally found in dairy, milk fat, and oil of various organ meats and fish. Beta-Carotene is also a source of Vitamin A and it can be found in many different orange vegetables such as pumpkins, carrots, squash, cantaloupe, apricots, grapefruit, yams, and seven some dark green vegetables. One of the reasons many people stay away from Vitamin A is because it is associated with fatty foods normally, however the vegetable sources of Beta-Carotene (which also contain Vitamin A) are free of fat. The more prominent the color of the fruit or veggie in question, the more Beta-Carotene (and thus Vitamin A as well) you stand to consume.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Vitamin A Palmitate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">This supplement is meant to help maintain the integrity of mucus membranes, as well as the health of skin, bones, and teeth. In order for the immune system to work like normal, Vitamin A is a requirement.

Niacin (Vitamin B3) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Of all of the B vitamins, Niacin is considered to be one of the most stable. It is water soluble and it is vital in sustaining life. It resists the effects of those elements which may cause erosion such as wind, heat, light, alkali, and acids. Its appearance is in the form of white powder with crystalline grains. Both Niacinamide and Niacin are soluble in alcohol and water, and are quite rapidly absorbed into the digestive system once consumed. The body often won't store extra amounts of these vitamins within the liver\; however the majority of it is usually expelled during urination.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the most important roles of Niacin is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins, hence the term “Niacin flush” which it is sometimes associated with, and the reason that Niacin is often found in such high stores in the liver, the detoxification center of the body. It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. These reactions include, but are not limited to processes which strengthen cell integrity and also produce energy for the body to use, meaning that without Niacin, the body would operate much more slowly, would be much weaker, and would also not be able to build many energy reserves. Through this indirect influence it helps the production of DNA, in the breakdown and metabolizing of fats, and in the general maturation of each individual cell.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The body is often in great need of Niacin, and being able to provide this level of Niacin can be difficult without correct dietary scheduling. Foods that are high in protein are a great source of Niacin because the body can later convert amino acids such as Tryptophan (one that is found in high stores in turkey) into Niacin. Some foods which are great sources of Niacin include fish, poultry, eggs, beans, and other dairy. Niacin also blocks fats from making their way into the blood stream to some extent, so there is not such a high content of free-roaming fats in the blood stream. Because of this ability, anyone that is taking medications which alter the amount of fat in the blood should consult a doctor before use, lest the effects of this supplement exacerbate the effectiveness of their medication. </p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Niacin</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking Niacin at about 20mg per day or more has been shown in many scientific tests to increase overall metabolism. Taking too much Niacin can over time cause a slowdown or stoppage of the body’s breakdown of fats.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Niacin is an excellent supplement for vegetarians, vegans, and people who frequently consume alcohol. This is because diets that are low on meat are also low on Niacin since some of the largest stores of Niacin come from Tryptophan. Also, taking too much alcohol can inhibit the body’s ability to correctly absorb Niacin. Therefore, these demographics may benefit from taking an additional Niacin supplement to help even out their dietary lack of Vitamin B3. Niacin deficiency is actually quite prevalent among Americans, with symptoms including dementia, canker sores, gastrointestinal problems, low blood sugar, muscle tension and pains, inflammation of the skin, insomnia, fatigue, digestion problems, dizziness, headaches, and a whole host of other problems. Pellagra is a fatal disease which is often associated with extreme Niacin deficiency in the diet. This can result in debilitating mental issues, skin problems and additional gastrointestinal symptoms if left untreated. The best way to prevent this from occurring is to keep up Niacin levels in the body.</p> ;7.75;NIA-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/niacin-usp.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Vitamins;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_195.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Bearberry Leaf Extract 4:1 (Uva Ursi) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Bearberry Leaf has historically been used as a substitute for tobacco by the Native Americans in their ceremonial pipes since it resulted in a more tolerable smoking experience. The somewhat informal name Bearberry is translated from the Latin, 'Uva Ursi' which translates more literally as 'bear grape'. The berries that the plant produces are known to be a favorite of bears.

Calcium Citrate may even be fully digested by people that have a gastric acid deficiency in their bodies.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Calcium is found the most throughout the human body of any other mineral, it is absolutely essential to maintain high levels of Calcium in order for the body to function properly. Osteoporosis, or as it is sometimes called, 'brittle bone syndrome', is caused when there is a Calcium deficiency in the body. Whenever levels of Calcium have hit a low, Calcium will actually be extracted from the bones to redistribute throughout the body in an attempt to level out. Processes such as blood clotting and nerve impulse transmission need to be fueled by Calcium in order to operate properly. On top of that Calcium is also important for the purposes of maintaining strong bones and teeth as well as muscle contraction. Calcium can also be useful in the binding and neutralization of generally harmful molecules in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the largest sources of Calcium is in dairy, with just one small serving of dairy containing about 300mg, or one fourth of the total daily value for Calcium. However, Calcium is also found in many other natural sources such as seaweed, nuts, legumes, and quinoa. Despite its wide distribution throughout the food pyramid, some people still suffer from Hypocalcemia (or Vitamin D deficiency) which causes issues with Calcium absorption. This is because Calcium can only be correctly absorbed by the body with the help of Vitamin D. A good Calcium rich diet or supplement routine should still include appropriate levels of Vitamin D in it for this reason. </p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Calcium Citrate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As mentioned before, Calcium is an essential ingredient in the processes of blood coagulation, proper energy production, and glandular secretion.

Calcium Citrate - 1kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Calcium Citrate comes in the form of a vaguely tart salt-like compound made up of Citric Acid and Calcium. It is used as an additive in food to impart that tart flavor into various dishes, aside from its main usage as a supplement with health benefits. It can also be used as a preservative and a way to soften water.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Calcium Citrate and Calcium Carbonate both contain Calcium, but while Calcium Carbonate may be the most popularly used form of Calcium supplement, this does not make it accessible to everyone. Calcium Citrate is a perfect alternative to Calcium Carbonate for those that have weak or sensitive stomachs, or other gastrointestinal disorders, since the Calcium Carbonate is more likely to cause stomach upset when used. Calcium Citrate may even be fully digested by people that have a gastric acid deficiency in their bodies.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Calcium is found the most throughout the human body of any other mineral, it is absolutely essential to maintain high levels of Calcium in order for the body to function properly. Osteoporosis, or as it is sometimes called, 'brittle bone syndrome', is caused when there is a Calcium deficiency in the body. Whenever levels of Calcium have hit a low, Calcium will actually be extracted from the bones to redistribute throughout the body in an attempt to level out.

Caffeine Powder (Synthetic) - 25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">This synthetic Caffeine powder is a particular kind of psychoactive stimulant called Trimexylxanthine, which is a part of the larger Xanthine family. These are naturally occurring and are found in a few different plants.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Caffeine sends a shock to the central nervous system thereby stimulating it and ridding the mind of feelings of tiredness. Some of the most common sources of Caffeine are in sports drinks, energy drinks, tea, coffee, chocolate, anything containing guarana, and most soft drinks.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CAFFEINE POWDER</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Caffeine provides an almost instantaneous increase to general alertness and is useful in many situations in which one may need to temporarily give their own energy levels a quick boost. Of course, cognitive functions still need real sleep to be fully restored, so Caffeine should not be used as a substitute for a good night’s sleep. However it is quite useful in situations in which sleep may not be possible for some time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Caffeine is also an ingredient found in many diet pills because of its effects on exercise and digestion. Not only does Caffeine help to quell large appetites to some degree, it also acts as a diuretic helping rid the body of excess water weight\; it helps burn calories in a small way, and its energy increasing effects are helpful to athletes that wish to continue their exercise regimen despite feelings of tiredness that naturally coincide with strenuous exercise. Of course, these effects are not meant to replace exercise, but to increase the effectiveness of a well rounded exercise and diet plan. Caffeine alone will not be enough to stimulate weight loss.</p>;414.10;CPS-25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/caffeine-powder-anhydrous.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_291.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">The body’s ability to actually continually produce GABA on its own is somewhat hampered by the fact that B-chain vitamins are required for all of the reactions that take place, in order to form and eventually synthesize GABA. Therefore, to keep GABA levels high, make sure to consume foods rich in B chain vitamins, especially ones with high Vitamin B6 content. Foods high in protein are also needed for successful GABA synthesis.

Therefore processed foods, the snacks which seem to make up a large majority in American diets\; are not very rich in MSM, which is why supplementation may be needed in some cases. Any foods which have been stored for long periods of time or which have been dehydrated, will have lost any MSM content when this occurred. This is unfortunate as MSM is a large supplier of raw materials that the body needs in order to function correctly. 34% of MSM is made up of Sulfur, meaning that this supplement can also function as a competent source of Sulfur.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Since Sulfur is so prevalent in the bodies of living organisms, this makes it a part of at least 150 compounds that can be found in the body including proteins, hormones, and even more physically prominent aspects such as skin and hair.

Spirulina Powder - 250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Due to the environment that this algae is usually found in, it is able to absorb both the rich amino acids and all of the vitamins present in the water, compacting them all in the form of a single celled organism which can then be consumed to reap those benefits of those vitamins later by putting them directly into the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">As a bonus, Spirulina acts as a great source of Vitamin B12, essential fatty acids, Beta Carotene, and Chlorophyll. Some of these elements are only present in high amounts in the diets of meat eaters and other nutrients like Beta-Carotene and Chlorophyll are useful in that they help the body get rid of toxins and act as antioxidants which further promote a healthy immune system by getting rid of free radicals. Also, even though carrots are generally credited with being one of the richest sources of Beta-Carotene, as it turns out, the amount in Spirulina is ten times that which is in carrots.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because of the amount of nutrients in it which are present in meat and which most people usually receive from meat in their own personal diets\; Spirulina has been the number one choice in supplements for people with a vegetarian diet. It even has these nutrients in quantities that are sufficient enough to use it as a regular supplement (in other words, you need not eat thirty six spoonfuls of Spirulina to get the effect of one forkful of steak, they level out just about. It even has more protein in it then soybeans which are traditionally cited as the best source of protein when on a vegetarian diet.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Spirulina</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Spirulina has such positive nutritional content that it is called the world’s richest whole food which can be found naturally. Not only that, but it is sometimes called “green food” as well due to the fact that it has such an enormous amount of healthy minerals in it and it also has such low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram). And if using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than 3/4 the amount of calories in protein per gram.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Due to the large amount of Iron in Spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does Spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body’s ability to absorb protein. This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. In this way, Spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meat. Spirulina contains a concentration of very essential amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but that we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina is thus, the one stop shop for essential amino acids which help to repair the body when it is damaged in any way and keep it running regularly. Those who have a poor diet which is mostly made up of processed foods such as chips and microwaveable meals, as well as those people that identify as vegetarian or vegan should all consider taking this supplement to make up for the nutrients that their diet is lacking.

Vitamin B5 Calcium Pantothenate - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">There are several different forms that Pantothenic Acid comes in. As far as supplemental sources are concerned, D-Calcium Pantothenate is the most popular source of this vitamin since it is much more stable than Pantothenic Acid bound to Calcium. Absorption of this source into the digestive tract is much simpler as well. Just about every single fruit and vegetable has some amount of Pantothenic Acid in it (which is what gave the acid it’s name, as in the original Greek, “Pantos” means everywhere), with the best sources being chicken, milk, beef, and mushrooms.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pantothenic Acid is particularly important because of its relation to Coenzyme A. The body converts Pantothenic Acid into Pantethine. Pantethine is a building block of CoA, which itself is important in supporting various bodily functions including The Krebs Cycle, as well as the conversion of various nutrients, proteins, sugars, and fat into energy that the body can use. It also helps to destroy toxins in the liver and break down drugs as well as synthesizing Cholesterol, Choline, and Melatonin. Another chemical resulting indirectly from the breakdown of Pantothenic Acid in the body is ACP. ACP helps to protect nerves from being damaged easily.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin B5</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The presence of Pantothenic Acid throughout the body allows bodily growth to keep up at a normal level, letting all normal bodily functions to run smoothly.

Vitamin B5 Calcium Pantothenate - 250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">There are several different forms that Pantothenic Acid comes in. As far as supplemental sources are concerned, D-Calcium Pantothenate is the most popular source of this vitamin since it is much more stable than Pantothenic Acid bound to Calcium. Absorption of this source into the digestive tract is much simpler as well. Just about every single fruit and vegetable has some amount of Pantothenic Acid in it (which is what gave the acid it’s name, as in the original Greek, “Pantos” means everywhere), with the best sources being chicken, milk, beef, and mushrooms.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pantothenic Acid is particularly important because of its relation to Coenzyme A. The body converts Pantothenic Acid into Pantethine. Pantethine is a building block of CoA, which itself is important in supporting various bodily functions including The Krebs Cycle, as well as the conversion of various nutrients, proteins, sugars, and fat into energy that the body can use. It also helps to destroy toxins in the liver and break down drugs as well as synthesizing Cholesterol, Choline, and Melatonin. Another chemical resulting indirectly from the breakdown of Pantothenic Acid in the body is ACP. ACP helps to protect nerves from being damaged easily.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin B5</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The presence of Pantothenic Acid throughout the body allows bodily growth to keep up at a normal level, letting all normal bodily functions to run smoothly.

Biotin 1% (Vitamin B7) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">In other words, Biotin functions as a form of Vitamin B and is a part of the same vitamin chain that it belongs to. Sometimes Biotin is even referred to as Vitamin B7, or even Vitamin H, and in some cases Coenzyme R. Biotin is involved in the essential process of turning fatty acids, sugars such as glucose, and amino acids into energy that the body can use as fuel. Biotin also plays a key role in the body’s manufacture of carboxylase enzymes which regulate the healthy growth and appearance of hair follicles and skin. In addition Biotin helps maintain healthy blood cells and bone marrow as well as strong nerve tissue.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Biotin can be found naturally in the human body in small quantities. It is usually located and stored in the brain, muscle, and liver. There is also a small amount of the body’s Biotin which is directly synthesized in the intestine via the bacteria present inside that regulates daily production and need. However, this is a small amount, and in order to truly have a balanced and healthy diet, Biotin must be found in meals every once in a while. It can be found in dishes that include egg yolk, liver, nuts, grainy cereals, beans, and legumes. While processed foods may still contain some level of Biotin, if altering diet specifically for increased Biotin intake it may be best to stick with less processed foods, as the heat involved in cooking and maintaining freshness of these processed food items may inadvertently kill a lot of the Biotin available in these sources. The fresher the foods are, the higher the levels of Biotin that will be found in them.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Biotin 1%</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Biotin’s main use for the human body is its ability to act as a Coenzyme during the synthesis process for a wide array of different enzymes involved in metabolizing nutrients including sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This makes Biotin essential in the conversion of all of these energy sources into the resulting energy that they would create to then fuel the body. It also correctly allows the body to use blood sugar for the purposes of energy consumption.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">If one is deficient in levels of Biotin, this will become obvious due to symptoms such as hair loss, as well as a rash that can be seen anywhere from the eyes, the mouth, the nose, or the genitals. The less obvious neurological issues that may be caused by Biotin deficiency range from depression and lethargy to hallucinations, and the extremities feeling numb. The unique kind of rash that Biotin deficiency can result in is so iconic that some medical professionals may refer to it as Biotin deficient face right off the bat.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Avoid Biotin deficiency by keeping away from raw egg whites and long term use of any antibiotics or anti-seizure medicines.

It also correctly allows the body to use blood sugar for the purposes of energy consumption.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">If one is deficient in levels of Biotin, this will become obvious due to symptoms such as hair loss, as well as a rash that can be seen anywhere from the eyes, the mouth, the nose, or the genitals. The less obvious neurological issues that may be caused by Biotin deficiency range from depression and lethargy to hallucinations, and the extremities feeling numb. The unique kind of rash that Biotin deficiency can result in is so iconic that some medical professionals may refer to it as Biotin deficient face right off the bat.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Avoid Biotin deficiency by keeping away from raw egg whites and long term use of any antibiotics or anti-seizure medicines. There is a certain protein contained in egg whites that will bind with Biotin and effectively neutralize it.</p>  ;226.82;BIO-25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/biotin-1-vitamin-b7.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Vitamins;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_429.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) - 1kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Besides actively being involved in the process of creating energy, Riboflavin is also responsible for eventually being transformed into the coenzymes FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) and FMN (flavin mononucleotide). These coenzymes act upon ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and help transport it throughout the body. In this way, riboflavin becomes important in two different facets of energy production, as ATP is the chemical that allows energy to both be created and stored in the muscles for later.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Riboflavin helps cells utilize oxygen better and keeps the eyes sharp, and the nails, hair, and skin growing like a charm. It is a necessary component in the process that leads to cells growing. Because Riboflavin is in so many different foods, someone that eats a well balanced diet probably has no need to supplement Riboflavin. Some of the more abundant sources of this vitamin include tongue and organ meats, seaweed, fish with heavy oil content in their bodies such as mackerel, herring, eel, and trout, and brewer’s yeast.

Vitamin B12 (Pure Cyanocobalamin) - 10g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12, once consumed, is incorporated by the body with a substance called Gastric IF (which stands for intrinsic factor) and then taken into the intestinal tract. It is Gastric IF which allows Vitamin B12 to be taken into the blood, rather than simply being lost through the digestion process. This is how it is eventually stored, meaning that having a condition which causes a shortage of IF for whatever reason, will eventually result in lowered amounts of Vitamin B12 in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The nerve cells need Vitamin B12 to function appropriately since Vitamin B12 is responsible for producing the chemical which allows for DNA and RNA replication to take place. Like most B-chain vitamins, Vitamin B12 is known to work better when used along with other B-chain vitamins, specifically Vitamin B9. This helps the creation and regulation of blood cells to go much more smoothly and also prevents anemia from occurring. Vitamin B12 indirectly assists the facilitation of certain enzymes which go on to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids. This means that Vitamin B12 is necessary for metabolism whether it is indirect or not.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 can be found in many different foods as a natural component. Of course because of its affiliation with protein, this mainly means that it is located in animal products for the most part. It can be found in most fish meats, beef, and poultry, and can also be found in a lot of dairy products. Excluding fortified foods, the only sources of Vitamin B12 that might be considered reliable are sources from dairy or meat. Vitamin B12 is released during digestion because it is bound to proteins and must be broken down by stomach acids in order for it to be released. Therefore if someone has weak stomach acid or a reduced gastric acid output this means it will be hard to get the necessary daily value of Vitamin B12 from natural sources. This is why multivitamins and supplements exist.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Vitamin B12</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The main thing that Vitamin B12 is known for is being able to create new red blood cells. Vitamin B12 also helps to maintain the health of the nervous system and create and replicate DNA and RNA, the building blocks of cells.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 directly helps the nervous system by metabolizing fatty acids in a certain way which aids in the production of Myelin. Myelin is a special coating that covers nerve endings. If the Myelin sheath coating the nerves is compromised in any way it will lead to irreversible damage to the  nervous system, especially if the lack of exposure to copious amounts of Vitamin B12 takes place over a prolonged period.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Having too much homocysteine in the body is generally seen as a negative thing because of its potential to cause damage to blood cells.

Vitamin B12 1% (Cyanocobalamin) - 5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 is often used as a food additive as its properties allow food to be converted more easily into energy when consumed. This is especially true for foods that are rich in protein since the Vitamin B12 is meant to bind to protein molecules. HCL in the stomach acid then breaks down the foods, allowing the Vitamin B12 to be released from the proteins and then go on to help the body use the newly digested food as energy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12, once consumed, is incorporated by the body with a substance called Gastric IF (which stands for intrinsic factor) and then taken into the intestinal tract. It is Gastric IF which allows Vitamin B12 to be taken into the blood rather than simply being lost through the digestion process. This is how it is eventually stored, which means that having a condition which causes a shortage of IF for whatever reason, will eventually result in lowered amounts of Vitamin B12 in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The nerve cells need Vitamin B12 to function appropriately since Vitamin B12 is responsible for producing the chemical which allows for DNA and RNA replication to take place. Like most B-chain vitamins, Vitamin B12 is known to work better when used along with other B-chain vitamins, specifically Vitamin B9. This helps the creation and regulation of blood cells go much more smoothly and also prevents anemia from occurring. Vitamin B12 indirectly assists the facilitation of certain enzymes which go on to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids. This means that Vitamin B12 is necessary for metabolism whether it is indirect or not.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 can be found in many different foods as a natural component. Of course because of its affiliation with protein, this mainly means that it is located in animal products for the most part. It can be found in most fish meats, beef, and poultry, and can also be found in a lot of dairy products. Excluding fortified foods, the only sources of Vitamin B12 that might be considered reliable are sources from dairy or meat. Vitamin B12 is released during digestion because it is bound to proteins and must be broken down by stomach acids in order for it to be released.

These coenzymes have been named NAD and NADH respectively. Taken in amounts of about 100mg or less, both Niacin and Niacinamide ostensibly perform the same actions. When taken at levels greater than 100mg though, this is where their overall effects begin to differ. Niacin is able to help the body balance the levels of good and bad cholesterol present in the blood, while Niacinamide is essential in monitoring insulin levels, blood sugar content, and health of joints. Niacinamide may also be used along with other supplements and minerals to increase the overall effectiveness and health of the nervous system, the digestive system and the circulatory system.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Of all of the B vitamins, Niacin is considered to be one of the most stable. It is water soluble and it is vital in sustaining life. It resists the effects of those elements which may cause erosion such as wind, heat, light, alkali, and acids. Both Niacinamide and Niacin are soluble in alcohol and water, and are quite rapidly absorbed into the digestive system once consumed. The body often won't to store extra amounts of these vitamins within the liver\; however the majority of it is usually expelled during urination.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the most important roles of Niacinamide is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins. Hence the term “Niacin flush” which it is sometimes associated with and the reason that Niacinamide is often found in such high stores in the liver, the detoxification center of the body. It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain sex based hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. These reactions include, but are not limited to processes which strengthen cell integrity and also produce energy for the body to use\; meaning that without Niacin or Niacinamide, the body would operate much more slowly, would be much weaker, and would also not be able to build many energy reserves.

Most refined foods lose Vitamin B6 in the refining process, and even cooking a food will cause most of the Vitamin B6 concentration to be lost if not all. This means foods being taken specifically for their Vitamin B6 content must be stored and prepared appropriately or you risk losing the entire point of them.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pyridoxine may be used immediately after consuming and makes its way quickly from the liver into the blood stream. Anyone who is taking up a diet involving fasting or in any way causing a reduction of food intake will usually also result in the loss of vital Vitamin B6. At the end of the day once you have eaten, most Vitamin B6 consumed will be expelled in the urine, and the rest will have been either used by the body or stored in the muscle. It takes Vitamin B6 about 8 hours to go fully through the system.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The highest concentrations of Vitamin B6 are found in organ meats and whole grains\; however dairy products such as eggs and yogurt are appropriate sources as well. Vitamin B6 may also be found in various nuts and legumes, and fruits such as bananas and prunes. Vegetables containing Vitamin B6 include cabbage, potatoes, and cauliflower.

Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine HCL) - 500g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B6 can be destroyed easily through food processing and from extended exposure to the sunlight. Most refined foods lose Vitamin B6 in the refining process, and even cooking a food will cause most of the Vitamin B6 concentration to be lost if not all. This means foods being taken specifically for their Vitamin B6 content must be stored and prepared appropriately or you risk losing the entire point of them.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pyridoxine may be used immediately after consuming and makes its way quickly from the liver into the blood stream. Anyone who is taking up a diet involving fasting or in any way causing a reduction of food intake will usually also result in the loss of vital Vitamin B6. At the end of the day once you have eaten, most Vitamin B6 consumed will be expelled in the urine, and the rest will have been either used by the body or stored in the muscle. It takes Vitamin B6 about 8 hours to go fully through the system.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The highest concentrations of Vitamin B6 are found in organ meats and whole grains\; however dairy products such as eggs and yogurt are appropriate sources as well. Vitamin B6 may also be found in various nuts and legumes, and fruits such as bananas and prunes. Vegetables containing Vitamin B6 include cabbage, potatoes, and cauliflower. This vitamin may also be found in high quantity in avocado.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Pyridoxine HCL</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">This vitamin is involved in many different metabolic functions and usually works as a coenzyme in them to make sure that this metabolism all goes according to plan. Vitamin B6 is especially essential for amino acid metabolism and it is also used in the production of GABA.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Pyridoxals in general facilitate the metabolism and conversion to energy of all food types and are instrumental in helping to release energy that has been stored for later use in the muscles. It also helps to produce both red blood cells and new antibodies and keeps up synthesis of DNA and RNA.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Most amino acids are made up of various proteins and come from foods that are major sources of protein. This means that the effects that Vitamin B6 has on metabolism of amino acids can be extended to proteins in general.

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin D3 is sometimes referred to as its scientific name, Cholecalciferol. There are two different sources of the hormone which regulates the body’s production and consumption of calcium. This includes Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) and Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol). However, the latter is generally thought if as an inferior source\; usually found in oily fish, fortified milk and various other dairy and grains.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The reason that Vitamin D3 is generally preferred to Vitamin D2 is that it is more easily absorbed by the body, and more commonly found as it is naturally produced and it also has a greater overall effect.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin D levels are moderated by the sunlight, as there is a chemical contained in the skin which can absorb the Vitamin D being radiated out through the sun’s rays. Simply being in the sun for fifteen minutes at a time can supply the body with up to 5,000 IU of Vitamin D. As a fat soluble vitamin, it can also be found in food with high fat content, particularly oily fish and other animal products. Its solubility in oil allows it to be stored in the body to some extent as well.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Vitamin D3</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Not having enough Vitamin D3 in your system can lead to a deficiency which has a variety of negative side effects associated with it. Rickets, a disease resulting in deformation of bones and teeth, is quite common in children that have low Vitamin D3 levels. Adults with low Vitamin D3 can develop a condition called Osteomalacia (a disease with similar effects to Rickets)\; or the more common Osteoporosis, which causes bone weakness as calcium is taken out of the bones steadily and provided to other parts of the body that need it.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin D does not only promote the absorption of calcium but also of magnesium, another mineral essential to good growth. Vitamin D is necessary in the metabolic process of Vitamin A and it is needed for the body to process phosphorous correctly. All of the health benefits that Vitamin D provides to the body are part of one much larger procedure whose main goal is to preserve the density of bone and teeth structures.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This vitamin, along with Vitamin A, is useful in treatment of children and of the elderly who have developed Rickets.

Calcium Lactate - 250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Calcium Lactate is extensively used as a food additive, particularly as an important ingredient in baking powder and it is naturally present in aged cheese. It is the chemical compound added to fresh fruits and vegetable to increase their shelf life. Calcium Lactate is used in medicine as a cure for Hyperacidity, and to treat various disorders caused by low levels of calcium in the body. The body contains approximately one kilogram of calcium, the most abundant mineral in the human body. A large amount of that, approximately 99%, is found in the bones and stored as calcium phosphates. As calcium exerts 3 important functions, so does its important component, Calcium Lactate. Calcium which exerts its function in the form of calcium phosphate, is important in supporting the activities of other minerals that help maintain bone mass and structure. Calcium found in and outside the cell is used as an alternative to deliver electric signals among hormones. It stimulates the release of acetylcholine and causes muscle contraction.  <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CALCIUM LACTATE</h2> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Calcium Lactate can prevent Osteoporosis. It protects pre-menopausal women from the early onset of bone loss  and helps post-menopausal women from encountering possible fatal fractures and falls.

Magnesium Carbonate - 250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium is a requirement in the synthesis of various chemicals such as nucleic acid, fat, protein, etc. It assists in the body’s ability to make use of Glucose and is important in the process of transferring energy throughout the body due to its relation to Glucose. It keeps the heart healthy by dilating the arteries and blood vessels to an acceptable level. Without Magnesium, blood vessels in the body may begin to shrink and cause blood flow throughout the body to be stymied dangerously. Magnesium also helps keep up levels of oral health and immune system efficiency.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium can be found in a wide variety of foods, including beans, nuts, grains, green vegetables especially of the leafy variety, and many types of seafood just to name a few nonspecific areas. Unfortunately, even though Magnesium is found in so many different foods, contemporary diets do not have much room for these specific kinds of foods so it may be prudent to supplement if this is the case for you personally. There can even be situations in which Magnesium is lost much more rapidly than a Magnesium rich diet can make up for. This can be sped up by vomiting, diarrhea, issues involving the intestine’s ability to absorb magnesium correctly, etc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are a few different groups of people that are at a higher risk for suffering Magnesium deficiency. This list includes the elderly, people that use diuretics excessively, and diabetics. Women who take “the pill” as a form of contraception are a part of this overarching group to. Many people in these groups could benefit greatly from Magnesium supplementation to increase overall bodily health. It has also been shown that the efficiency of Magnesium supplementation increases greatly when taking Calcium supplements along with it. For best results it is recommended that Magnesium be consumed at a ratio of 1:2 with Calcium.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Magnesium Carbonate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As it turns out, Magnesium is a necessary component for all cells in the body to function normally. Half of the total Magnesium found in the body is located in tissue, organs, etc., while the other half is found bound with Calcium in the bone. There is a use for all Magnesium. There is a remaining 1% of Magnesium after these calculations are done and this 1% is located in the bloodstream.

Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) - 5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Being more effective than regular L-Carnitine in that very little dilution of the original concentration occurs when it is administered directly to systemic circulation, it is a bit more on the expensive side given that manufacturing costs are much higher. Due to the association that ALCAR has with the specific acetyl group that it belongs to, it is known for the great variety of benefits it provides to general brain functions and mental health. In fact, Alpha Lipoic Acid, another type of acid found within the body that works in tandem with ALCAR has recently been discovered to have immense benefits when broken down in conjunction with the aforementioned ALCAR. Once again, because of its level of concentration, it is much easier for the system to absorb ALCAR than its base relative, L-Carnitine. It is this very attribute of ALCAR that makes it such an effective type of antioxidant.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>BENEFITS PROVIDED BY Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Once again, one of the major health benefits associated with Acetyl-L-Carnitine is its efficiency in breaking down fatty acids and turning them into a useable energy source to fuel the body. In this sense it helps regulate human metabolism at a basic cellular level. Even though the body regularly produces acceptable amounts of ALCAR all by itself, taking additional supplements can still greatly speed up the speed of this cellular metabolism process, thereby resulting in more energy conserved, less energy wasted.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">During this process of energy production, Carnitines are also known for being able to assist in the removal of waste products from the system\; another reason that these are produced by the liver, an organ which is known for acting as a kind of filter. Generally the body of a healthy person will relegate the kidneys towards managing healthy levels of Carnitines, but bodies afflicted with any sort of kidney disease and in some cases other types of cardiovascular illnesses will result in significantly reduced levels of Carnitines.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>ACETYL-L-CARNITINE AND ALPHA LIPOIC ACID</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">When these two acids are combined, the result is a synergistic effect which allows the mental power and generally everyday brain functions of a person to become much more focused and enhanced. Each of these compounds has properties which assist the brain on their own, but when combined the effect is magnified to even greater proportions. It is because of this that the two are generally found blended together in the various products.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Alpha Lipoic Acid is another enzyme which is naturally occurring on its own because it is so important in the process of cellular metabolism. Its usefulness when blended with ALCAR becomes clear in a few different ways. For one, it is able to greatly speed up the transportation of Glucose to muscle tissue resulting in a greater sense of both speed and endurance in the body. Secondly, it allows a greater breadth of fatty acid content to actually be consumed during the metabolizing process so that less weight is gained and more energy is provided to the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">While the powder itself may be a bit off-putting to the taste, here these supplements can be found in proportional amounts contained within capsules so that the slight burning sensation that occurs when the substances hit the tongue need not be endured.</p>;142.02;ALCAR-5KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/acetyl-l-carnitine-alcar.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_161.jpg;;;<endrecord>
L-Arginine HCL - 5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">L-Arginine is a type of amino acid that works to maintain the integrity of the skin, joints, liver, and muscles. It also helps in maintaining good levels of blood sugar, hormones, and keeps the immune system functioning well.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because though the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells, and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins. Urea is needed in order for the body to expel Ammonia through the urine however\; urea would not be manufactured without Arginine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine is also helpful in releasing insulin when necessary and in creating and facilitating the creation of important hormones. Arginine helps to stop the restriction of blood flow throughout the body. It allows blood vessels to relax rather than be constricted, dilating them so that there is better flow of oxygen throughout the body.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by L-Arginine HCL</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are many different foods which contain L-Arginine including soy products, barley, almonds and other nuts, raisins, types of cereal, meats, oats, and wheat products including flour. These are all major sources of Arginine.  There are some conditions which cause people to not be able to accumulate or produce enough Arginine. If you happen to have one such condition, Arginine supplementation is the best alternative for you. Also, those who are interested in maintaining strict levels of exercise should keep up their levels of Arginine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Arginine can be found in high concentrations in the skin. Muscles and connective tissues are also supported by the presence of Arginine in the blood. Creatine and nitrogen supplements are generally taken by body builders and exercise enthusiasts because of their ability to create energy and enhance muscle mass respectively. However, the strength and effectiveness of these supplements is determined by Arginine\; because without this amino acid, it would be impossible for the body to process these other elements, making Arginine just as important for exercise as either of the other two.</p>;99.62;L-ARGHCL-5KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-arginine-hcl.html;in stock;BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media//catalog/product/placeholder/default/BulkSupplementsBag1200.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Phenibut - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Phenibut was discovered in Russia by scientists who were looking for an alternative tranquilizing drug for cosmonauts to prevent anxiety, stress and panic without causing drowsiness. Although the traditional sedatives still assert their efficacy in relieving stress and anxiety and panic, they make the cosmonauts drowsy which are not acceptable to them as they need to stay awake while traveling in space.

Sucralose - 100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Most of the Sucralose people consume is not absorbed and passes through the body. The little that is absorbed is excreted in the urine, and doesn’t accumulate in the body. Sucralose is available in tabletop sweeteners and also as an ingredient in many products, including a variety of beverages, baked goods, desserts, dairy products, canned fruits, syrups and condiments. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar, and it can be used in place of or combined with sugar in cooking and baking. Sucralose has been studied extensively and has been found to be safe by experts and researchers around the world. Government agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have also reviewed the science on Sucralose and found it to be safe for human consumption.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As a no-calorie alternative to sugar, Sucralose-containing foods and beverages still allow people who are following a weight loss or weight management program to enjoy sweet, good tasting options.  For example, a light yogurt containing Sucralose can save 50 or more calories per serving compared to regular yogurt, and a 12-ounce glass of iced tea sweetened with Sucralose can save more than 100 calories compared to the same glass of tea sweetened with sugar. </p>  ;16.93;SRLS-100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/sucralose.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_164.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Sucralose - 50g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Most of the Sucralose people consume is not absorbed and passes through the body. The little that is absorbed is excreted in the urine, and doesn’t accumulate in the body. Sucralose is available in tabletop sweeteners and also as an ingredient in many products, including a variety of beverages, baked goods, desserts, dairy products, canned fruits, syrups and condiments. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar, and it can be used in place of or combined with sugar in cooking and baking. Sucralose has been studied extensively and has been found to be safe by experts and researchers around the world. Government agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have also reviewed the science on Sucralose and found it to be safe for human consumption.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As a no-calorie alternative to sugar, Sucralose-containing foods and beverages still allow people who are following a weight loss or weight management program to enjoy sweet, good tasting options.  For example, a light yogurt containing Sucralose can save 50 or more calories per serving compared to regular yogurt, and a 12-ounce glass of iced tea sweetened with Sucralose can save more than 100 calories compared to the same glass of tea sweetened with sugar. </p>  ;14.81;SRL-50;http://www.bulksupplements.com/sucralose.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_165.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Xylitol-250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Xylitol chewing gum can help people who have Otitis Media by helping remove the earwax that has accumulated in the ears and by helping unclog the middle ears with any obstruction. It also asserts it antibiotic properties by inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the Eustachian tube, a part of the ear that connects the nose and the ear. This is attributed to Xylitol's ability to form into different structures that prevent bacteria from growing and thriving in the ears. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Xylitol is also recommended for people with diabetes. It has a lower caloric content than table sugar, it is easily absorbed in the body and does not cause blood sugar level to rise that would further result to hyperglycemia. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Xylitol is used in the manufacture of nutraceuticals and women's hygienic products.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is naturally present in fruit and vegetable fibers and can be extracted from various fibrous food and other materials. </p>  <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY XYLITOL</h2> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Xylitol protects against tooth enamel damage and promotes its re-mineralization.

It has the ability to remineralize or restore tooth enamel resulting to stronger and healthier teeth. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Xylitol protects against Otitis Media. Xylitol's antibacterial properties prevent the proliferation of the Pneumococcus bacteria responsible for causing Pneumonia and other diseases, which include Otitis Media. Xylitol chewing gum is recommended to prevent Otitis Media due to the chewing and swallowing action of Xylitol which can remove wax and dirt from the ears. Xylitol has the ability to clean the middle ears by unclogging them of wax and dirt that have accumulated in that part of the inner ear. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Xylitol does not raise the body's blood sugar level. It is a sweetener that is as sweet as table sugar but has fewer calories and does not increase the sugar content in the blood to further aggravate hyperglycemia. It is the type of sweetener that does not contribute to weight gain thus recommended for people who are on a weight loss program.  </p>;7.75;XY-250;http://www.bulksupplements.com/xylitol.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_364.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Fish Oil Softgel (1000mg) - 300 Softgels;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Fish Oil is a great supplement because it contains both of these essential fatty acids which are responsible for keeping the risk of heart disease very low. While research is not totally conclusive in this area, a clear link has been established in numerous tests spurring the FDA to allow use of the phrase “may reduce risk of coronary heart disease” on products containing Fish Oil. These Omega-3 fatty acids are the building blocks of Eicosanoids, which are useful in their ability to reduce inflammation throughout the entire body. Fish Oil also helps maintain generally high levels of strong cardiovascular health.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This supplement is extracted from the tissues of fish with exceptionally oily bodily content such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, halibut, cod liver, whale, seal, and herring. These fish develop this oil in their bodies when they eat micro-algae, which helps in the synthesis of these acids, or by consuming other fish as prey which have already consumed this same micro-algae. Fish Oil supplements have been augmented by Vitamin E in order to ensure that they remain preserved.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are Omega-3 fatty acids present in other sources too, such as Flaxseed oil and Soybean oil, but these come in the form of Alpha-Linolenic Acid. These oils must go through a conversion process in order to reach the state of DHA and EPA\; and this conversion process causes most of the benefits brought on by these two fatty acids to be lost in the interim, bringing limited benefit if any. Not only that, but as we age, the body becomes less capable of performing this conversion process. This is why Fish Oil is a much better source of Omega-3 fatty acids.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Unfortunately Omega-3 fatty acids cannot be produced by the body and thus must be supplemented in the diet.

Calcium Carbonate-250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">One benefit of taking the supplement Calcium Carbonate versus Calcium found in naturally derived sources is that the supplement also helps to neutralize excess stomach acids which can cause nausea and upset stomach, as well as heartburn.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Calcium Carbonate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Calcium is found in large stores all throughout the human body as it is a substance that is vital towards the body performing all its correct functions. This is especially true since it is necessary for bones to maintain their strength and to prevent Osteoporosis. This is what occurs when Calcium levels are so low that the body actually borrows Calcium from the bones in order to supplement the other areas of the body lacking this mineral.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Aside from the dairy in which Calcium is found in such abundant stores, it is also found in legumes, nuts, seaweed, and quinoa. It is not enough to take just Calcium though, it is also necessary to have good levels of Vitamin D in the blood because Vitamin D promotes correct absorption of Calcium.</p> ;8.45;CALCARB-250;http://www.bulksupplements.com/calcium-carbonate.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_41.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Garcinia Cambogia 60% HCA Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Studies have indicated that the HCA interferes with the body's production of fat.

Garcinia Cambogia 60% HCA-100g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">The key ingredient in the Garcinia Cambogia fruit is Hydroxycitric Acid, or HCA. </p>   <h2 class="title" style=>BENEFITS PROVIDED BY Garcinia Cambogia Extract</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The first way that HCA helps is by acting as a fat blocker. Normally, the body will break down carbohydrates from the food which has been consumed into Glucose. Glucose, in turn, triggers the production of insulin which then leads to some of that Glucose being stored as body fat. HCA actually helps to lower blood Glucose levels, leading to lower amounts of insulin and less fat being stored.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The second way this supplement helps weight loss is by blocking the pathway of Citrate Lyase. This enzyme is critical to the process of converting carbohydrates into fat. As a natural 'fat-blocker,' Garcinia Cambogia actually helps to re-wire this process so that the body creates more Glycogen, which is used as an energy source. Another aspect of this process is that when more Glucose is stored as Glycogen, the brain 'feels' full faster and you tend to eat less. The production of LDL (bad) Cholesterol and triglycerides is also reduced. Additionally, research has also indicated that the supplement helps to control cortisol levels, which can also influence the amount of carbohydrates that are eventually stored as fat.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">HCA also increases serotonin levels within the brain. This natural hormone helps to regulate things like appetite, mood, and sleep. This intensifies the effect of feeling satisfied, lowers the instances of emotional eating, and leads to the body burning more of its stored fat. As serotonin levels are increased, stress is reduced and mood generally improves. As satiety is improved you will also experience less cravings for sugar, junk food, and other carbohydrates.</p>;9.16;GAR60HCA100;http://www.bulksupplements.com/garcinia-cambogia-60-hca.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_410.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Fish Oil Softgel (1000mg) - 100 Softgels;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Fish Oil is a great supplement because it contains both of these essential fatty acids which are responsible for keeping the risk of heart disease very low. While research is not totally conclusive in this area, a clear link has been established in numerous tests spurring the FDA to allow use of the phrase “may reduce risk of coronary heart disease” on products containing Fish Oil. These Omega-3 fatty acids are the building blocks of Eicosanoids, which are useful in their ability to reduce inflammation throughout the entire body. Fish Oil also helps maintain generally high levels of strong cardiovascular health.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This supplement is extracted from the tissues of fish with exceptionally oily bodily content such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, halibut, cod liver, whale, seal, and herring. These fish develop this oil in their bodies when they eat micro-algae, which helps in the synthesis of these acids, or by consuming other fish as prey which have already consumed this same micro-algae. Fish Oil supplements have been augmented by Vitamin E in order to ensure that they remain preserved.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are Omega-3 fatty acids present in other sources too, such as Flaxseed oil and Soybean oil, but these come in the form of Alpha-Linolenic Acid. These oils must go through a conversion process in order to reach the state of DHA and EPA\; and this conversion process causes most of the benefits brought on by these two fatty acids to be lost in the interim, bringing limited benefit if any.

In fact, Alpha Lipoic Acid, another type of acid found within the body that works in tandem with ALCAR has recently been discovered to have immense benefits when broken down in conjunction with the aforementioned ALCAR.

In addition, these BCAA's make up 40% of total body protein content and represent around 15 to 25 percent of total protein intake overall.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine is the product of protein hydrolysis by way of various enzymes present in the pancreas. This reaction is part of the overall digestive process and is absolutely necessary in maintaining healthy growth levels in children and infants, as well as keeping regulated nitrogen levels in human adults. Valine is essential in maintaining the structure of various proteins that it has been incorporated into. Isoleucine is again, a chemical used to help stimulate the production and circulation of energy throughout the body. Each of these different amino acids is taken directly into the muscle during the metabolic process which makes them great candidates for muscle building for athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone else that might be routinely involved in strenuous physical activity.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs are found in their greatest natural quantities in products such as red meat and many types of dairy. Protein supplements synthesized from an egg base or from whey are ideal for finding high amounts of BCAA's. Isoleucine alone is found in just about every type of food, but particularly high amounts are usually seen in all types of meats including fish, and various cheeses. Leucine is found in more complex and refined sources of sustenance such as corn, yeast, brown rice, etc. Valine is usually found in flour, soy, mushrooms, peanuts, and meats.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As mentioned before, branch chain amino acids are used as supplements among a large community of athletes and body builder types because of their properties which help improve rates of muscle re-growth and increase general energy production. This means that once the workout is over there are less negative effects afterwards such as excessive tiredness and painful joints and muscles. These BCAAs are particularly important for muscles which are attached to the skeletal structure since they act as their primary source of fuel when they are taxed by long exercise sessions.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs, because of their relation and necessity to exercise are needed in higher quantities than any of the body’s other essential amino acids. They help in the building of muscle because they decrease the speed at which proteins break down while at the same time promoting their synthesis. They enter the body, and after going through the metabolic process, are turned into muscle tissue. Another way in which isoleucine is important to the body is because of its capacity to help maintain blood sugar levels along with energy levels, and in helping the healing process of bones, skin, and muscle tissue all over the body. Any healthy diet must take Isoleucine into account as it is one of the essential amino acids that is not naturally produced within the body. Leucine is essential because this BCAA is what keeps protein synthesis going on at a normal pace. Valine also helps in synthesis of glucose, a process which takes place in the liver and is useful during any time in which anaerobic activity is taking place.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs may reach the pinnacle of importance as far as the life of an athlete is concerned, but they are often sought out by those that desire to maintain generally good health because of their multiple uses and healthy properties. These amino acids are metabolized, not in the liver as with most other amino acids, but in the muscle tissue, making them take instant effect during strenuous exercise, which increases their popularity among athletes. Even the smallest amount of exercise can lower levels of BCAAs, leading to feelings of exhaustion over a short time.

Well essentially, the problem that makes L-Carnosine less viable as a direct supplement, is that it is broken down by the body too quickly in smaller doses. It would be necessary to take much larger quantities of L-Carnosine at once to provide the same effectiveness that would come with taking a much smaller and more manageable amount of Beta Alanine.

Meats are the best sources of it because the highest concentrations of Choline are typically found in the fat portions of the cell membranes, meaning foods with higher fat content are more likely to have higher amounts of Choline. Choline is thought to be useful in muscle contraction, and general good coordination skills.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is useful in a variety of other ways too, such as cell communications, stabilizing the correct functions of muscles, regulation of impulse transmission through the nervous system, and in the production of Acetylcholine, which is known to influence state of mind, eating habits, and general behavior. Finally, Choline can also act as an antioxidant to some extent, protecting healthy cells from harmful free radicals.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Choline Bitartrate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is a nutrient necessary for the body in order to keep up the emulsification of fats and cholesterol, and to facilitate the movement of hormones to the correct areas of the body.

Choline also assists in the formation of Betaine, which is a methyl donor of no small importance.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Choline is especially important in establishing endurance when it comes to physical exercise. Choline becomes depleted very quickly in athletes that participate in taxing exercise regimens.

Inositol (Vitamin B8) Capsules - 100 Gelatin Capsules;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Inositol precedes phospholipids which are what make up the protective casing of a cell known as the membrane. This means that Inositol is what passes electrical energy through the cellular membrane where it can be used to facilitate many bodily reactions such as the creation of energy and regular cellular maintenance. In addition to that it has the ability to transport fats away from the liver.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Inositol can be found at various levels in many different types of foods including breakfast cereal, nuts, anything with bran, meats, whole grains, and many types of fruit, with oranges and cantaloupes containing the highest concentrations of Inositol.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Inositol is necessary to be taken daily in order for a certain level of health to be maintained. It can actually be found all throughout the body in various concentrations, including the brain, heart, and eyes.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Inositol can be manufactured by the body and is present in so many outside sources, few cases of deficiency are ever reported. However, if taking antibiotics over a long period of time, the body's need for Inositol will steadily increase. In addition, taking too much caffeine over a long time will cause stores of this nutrient to become depleted\; requiring supplementation eventually, especially for those that take in large amounts of caffeine commonly.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Inositol</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Inositol is needed to maintain the integrity of the cellular membrane, especially in those cells located in the bone marrow, brain, intestines, and eyes. It does this by keeping track of what comes in and out of a cell, letting in helpful nutrients and impulses while blocking toxins and other harmful things. Inositol also has the effect of releasing Calcium content present in a cell.

L-Glutamine Capsules - 100 Gelatin Capsules;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is by far the most important of all of the amino acids when it comes to metabolism. It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc., into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose\; one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis, as well as in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation. It is sometimes considered fuel for the brain too, as it is one of the few acids with the ability to make it beyond the blood-brain barrier.

It keeps the heart healthy by dilating the arteries and blood vessels to an acceptable level. Without Magnesium, blood vessels in the body may begin to shrink and cause blood flow throughout the body to be stymied dangerously. Magnesium also helps keep up levels of oral health and immune system efficiency.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium can be found in a wide variety of foods, including beans, nuts, grains, green vegetables especially of the leafy variety, and many types of seafood just to name a few nonspecific areas. Unfortunately, even though Magnesium is found in so many different foods, contemporary diets do not have much room for these specific kinds of foods so it may be prudent to supplement if this is the case for you personally.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are a few different groups of people that are at a higher risk for suffering Magnesium deficiency. This list includes the elderly, people that use diuretics excessively, and diabetics. Women who take “the pill” as a form of contraception are a part of this overarching group too. Many people in these groups could benefit greatly from Magnesium supplementation to increase overall bodily health. It has also been shown that the efficiency of Magnesium supplementation increases greatly when taking Calcium supplements along with it. For best results it is recommended that Magnesium be consumed at a ratio of 1:2 with Calcium.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Magnesium Gluconate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium is necessary in many different bodily reactions.

N,N-Dimethyl Glycine HCL (DMG) Capsules - 100 Gelatin Capsules;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Dimethyl Glycine (DMG) is a nutrient which can be found in many different foods, with particularly high concentrations existing in legumes and grains. It can also be manufactured by the body to a small degree. Taken as a supplement, DMG is able to facilitate the creation of many different chemicals through enzymatic reactions, including but not limited to Choline, Methionine, and other important neurotransmitters. The substance known as Betaine that DMG is so often compared to, is essentially actually just a Glycine which has been attached to three different methyl groups. This separates it from Dimethyl Glycine by only one methyl group.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Since DMG is so closely related to Glycine, it is also an important component in the production of energy for the body. It can assist in the exercise process by easing the pain felt by straining muscles and in reducing fatigue felt after particularly draining exercise. Glycine is considered nonessential, but is very important in the formation of various muscle tissues and it also helps with the maintenance of the digestive and nervous systems, keeping them in working order. By increasing the amount of Creatine as well as the amount of Glucose in the body, Glycine is able to create even more energy and assist in the growth of muscles, while also regulating levels of blood sugar. Glycine can be found at very high concentrations throughout the body, but particularly in the muscles, collagen and skin.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glycine is actually necessary in order for a good healthy digestive system to be kept intact by producing more bile that breaks down fats and separates nutrients out of food that can be used by the cells later. For this reason glycine is the chief ingredient in most commercially bought antacids.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by N,N-Dimethylglycine HCL</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">DMG can increase the effectiveness of the immune system while also helping cells to make better use of oxygen. It also functions as an antioxidant preventing healthy cells from being damaged by free radicals, in an indirect fashion. Lactic Acid is an acid that is credited with, when built up in large amounts over time, damaging muscle tissue. DMG is useful because it has the ability to neutralize this harmful acid, so not only does it promote muscle growth, but it actually discourages muscle degradation.</p>;9.16;DMG-CAP-100GC;http://www.bulksupplements.com/n-n-dimethyl-glycine-hcl-dmg-7187.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_48.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Taurine is derived from the reaction between Methionine and Cysteine when they become synthesized together.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine does not only add to muscle mass though, it also transports certain nutrients through the cell wall such as Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium. This keeps each individual cell healthy by electrically stabilizing the outer membrane using just the right amount of nutrients. Taurine allows for extra nerve impulses which better regulates muscle usage and keeps the level of ions located within a cell at a more acceptable level.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine affects the brain in such a way that it is useful to both the nervous system and the functioning of the heart too. Chenodeoxychloic Acid, one of the types of bile found in the stomach with the most abundance is made up of Taurine as a chief component. This means that in a sense, Taurine is also indirectly important in breaking down fats to be used by the body ads energy. It is necessary for this type of bile to be present in order for the body to absorb vitamins which have been dissolved into fatty solutions. Thus, Taurine is a necessary amino acid in that it allows for the digestion of fat soluble vitamins.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine is typically associated with energy drinks but also has many natural sources including meat and fish, dairy products, and brewer’s yeast.

Taurine is found in its highest concentrations in the white blood cells. Taurine does not only aid in immune system performance though, it also helps detoxify the body, and it helps to promote the integrity of cellular structures.

Athletes like to use Taurine because it keeps stamina up by reducing the pain felt after exercise and also, functioning very similar to Creatine, allows muscles to stay directly hydrated, adding to their overall volume.</p>;12.69;TAU-CAP-300VC;http://www.bulksupplements.com/taurine-3218.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_228.jpg;;;<endrecord>
Taurine Capsules - 100 Vegetarian Capsules;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">If there is not enough Taurine in the body, this can cause levels of nitric oxide to be raised, which, if at a high enough level, can cause blood flow and flow of oxygen through the blood to be significantly stymied in their travel to the muscles. Taurine is derived from the reaction between Methionine and Cysteine when they become synthesized together.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine does not only add to muscle mass though, it also transports certain nutrients through the cell wall such as Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium. This keeps each individual cell healthy by electrically stabilizing the outer membrane using just the right amount of nutrients. Taurine allows for extra nerve impulses which better regulates muscle usage and keeps the level of ions located within a cell at a more acceptable level.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine affects the brain in such a way that it is useful to both the nervous system and the functioning of the heart too. Chenodeoxychloic Acid, one of the types of bile found in the stomach with the most abundance is made up of Taurine as a chief component. This means that in a sense, Taurine is also indirectly important in breaking down fats to be used by the body ads energy. It is necessary for this type of bile to be present in order for the body to absorb vitamins which have been dissolved into fatty solutions. Thus, Taurine is a necessary amino acid in that it allows for the digestion of fat soluble vitamins.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine is typically associated with energy drinks but also has many natural sources including meat and fish, dairy products, and brewer’s yeast. Taurine is not protein integrated, making it one of the free amino acids which comes in higher quantities in the body.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Taurine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taurine is easily dissolved in water and is able to neutralize specific molecules which eventually result in the genesis of free radicals, molecules which damage the healthy cells in the body. In this sense it has antioxidant capabilities. Taurine is in fact very useful to the immune system, so much so that when someone is suffering from a deficiency of Taurine, the immune system is greatly weakened. Taurine is found in its highest concentrations in the white blood cells. Taurine does not only aid in immune system performance though, it also helps detoxify the body, and it helps to promote the integrity of cellular structures. This amino acid keeps calcium levels in the body regulated too.

When taken at levels greater than 100mg though, this is where their overall effects begin to differ. Niacin is able to help the body balance the levels of good and bad cholesterol present in the blood, while Niacinamide is essential in monitoring insulin levels, blood sugar content, and health of joints.

Garcinia Cambogia 60% HCA Powder-25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">The key ingredient in the Garcinia Cambogia fruit is Hydroxycitric Acid, or HCA. </p>   <h2 class="title" style=>BENEFITS PROVIDED BY Garcinia Cambogia Extract</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The first way that HCA helps is by acting as a fat blocker. Normally, the body will break down carbohydrates from the food which has been consumed into Glucose. Glucose, in turn, triggers the production of insulin which then leads to some of that Glucose being stored as body fat. HCA actually helps to lower blood Glucose levels, leading to lower amounts of insulin and less fat being stored.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The second way this supplement helps weight loss is by blocking the pathway of Citrate Lyase. This enzyme is critical to the process of converting carbohydrates into fat. As a natural 'fat-blocker,' Garcinia Cambogia actually helps to re-wire this process so that the body creates more Glycogen, which is used as an energy source. Another aspect of this process is that when more Glucose is stored as Glycogen, the brain 'feels' full faster and you tend to eat less. The production of LDL (bad) Cholesterol and triglycerides is also reduced. Additionally, research has also indicated that the supplement helps to control cortisol levels, which can also influence the amount of carbohydrates that are eventually stored as fat.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">HCA also increases serotonin levels within the brain. This natural hormone helps to regulate things like appetite, mood, and sleep. This intensifies the effect of feeling satisfied, lowers the instances of emotional eating, and leads to the body burning more of its stored fat. As serotonin levels are increased, stress is reduced and mood generally improves. As satiety is improved you will also experience less cravings for sugar, junk food, and other carbohydrates.</p>;459.33;GAR60HCA25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/garcinia-cambogia-60-hca.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_405.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Normally, the body will break down carbohydrates from the food which has been consumed into Glucose.

Vitamin B12 1% (Cyanocobalamin) Powder-25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 is often used as a food additive as its properties allow food to be converted more easily into energy when consumed. This is especially true for foods that are rich in protein since the Vitamin B12 is meant to bind to protein molecules. HCL in the stomach acid then breaks down the foods, allowing the Vitamin B12 to be released from the proteins and then go on to help the body use the newly digested food as energy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12, once consumed, is incorporated by the body with a substance called Gastric IF (which stands for intrinsic factor) and then taken into the intestinal tract. It is Gastric IF which allows Vitamin B12 to be taken into the blood rather than simply being lost through the digestion process. This is how it is eventually stored, which means that having a condition which causes a shortage of IF for whatever reason, will eventually result in lowered amounts of Vitamin B12 in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The nerve cells need Vitamin B12 to function appropriately since Vitamin B12 is responsible for producing the chemical which allows for DNA and RNA replication to take place. Like most B-chain vitamins, Vitamin B12 is known to work better when used along with other B-chain vitamins, specifically Vitamin B9. This helps the creation and regulation of blood cells go much more smoothly and also prevents anemia from occurring. Vitamin B12 indirectly assists the facilitation of certain enzymes which go on to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids. This means that Vitamin B12 is necessary for metabolism whether it is indirect or not.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 can be found in many different foods as a natural component. Of course because of its affiliation with protein, this mainly means that it is located in animal products for the most part. It can be found in most fish meats, beef, and poultry, and can also be found in a lot of dairy products. Excluding fortified foods, the only sources of Vitamin B12 that might be considered reliable are sources from dairy or meat. Vitamin B12 is released during digestion because it is bound to proteins and must be broken down by stomach acids in order for it to be released. Therefore if someone has weak stomach acid or a reduced gastric acid output this means it will be hard to get the necessary daily value of Vitamin B12 from natural sources. This is why multivitamins and supplements exist.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Vitamin B12 1%</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The main thing that Vitamin B12 is known for is being able to create new red blood cells. Vitamin B12 also helps to maintain the health of the nervous system and create and replicate DNA and RNA, the building blocks of cells.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin B12 directly helps the nervous system by metabolizing fatty acids in a certain way which aids in the production of Myelin. Myelin is a special coating that covers nerve endings. If the Myelin sheath coating the nerves is compromised in any way it will lead to irreversible damage to the  nervous system, especially if the lack of exposure to copious amounts of Vitamin B12 takes place over a prolonged period.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Having too much homocysteine in the body is generally seen as a negative thing because of its potential to cause damage to blood cells. Vitamin B9 and B12 are both credited with being able to cause the levels of homocysteine in the blood to be kept at lower amounts.</p> ;1039.53;B121%-25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/vitamin-b12-1-cyanocobalamin.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_91.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Whey Protein Powder Isolate 90% - 5KG pure powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Whey Protein Isolate is the purest form of Whey Protein where the water, fats and lactose content have been removed. It contains a larger amount of pure protein than Whey Protein Concentrate and Whey Protein Hydrolysate.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is a rich source of branched chain amino acids, essential amino acids which are largely found in muscle tissues and used primarily in the production of proteins and in enhancing physical performance. Leucine is the branched chain amino acid that is primarily responsible for initiating protein synthesis in the body.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The difference among these three forms of Whey Protein lies in their manner of filtration. Microfiltration and the ion exchangers method have been used in the production of Whey Protein Isolate.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Whey Protein Isolate contains a large amount of protein which can be further filtrated to yield a Whey Protein Isolate that is completely free of cholesterol, lactose, carbohydrates and fats. </p>  <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY WHEY PROTEIN POWDER ISOLATE 90% - CLEAN</h2> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Whey Protein Isolate is a very rich source of protein, which accounts for 90 percent of its total weight. It builds muscle tissues and repair damaged ones, helps in the recovery of tired and exhausted muscles after high intensity physical exercise. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Whey Protein can help prevent the body's accumulation of fats. Consuming Whey Protein Isolate in its pure form where a large percentage of fats have been removed can help you maintain a lean body. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;"> Whey Protein Isolate is good for people suffering from lactose intolerance. Unlike Whey Protein Concentrate and Whey Protein Hydrolysate, Whey Protein Isolate contains a very small amount of lactose or none at all, as this has been removed together with fats thus making it safe for people who cannot tolerate lactose.  </p>;84.78;WPISO-5KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/whey-protein-isolate-90.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_64.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Chlorella Blue-Green Algae Powder-10kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">While this type of algae grows naturally in all kinds of fresh water sources, the kind that is used by humans is cultivated in large pools and is exposed to large amounts of direct sunlight, clean water, and fresh air so as to make it as healthy and beneficial as possible. Special equipment is required to harvest these algae due to their small size. This plant reproduces once every twenty hours allowing it to spread rapidly.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">This algae is believed to be about 2 billion years old, and was one of the first plants to have anything that could be called a defined nucleus in its cellular structure. Despite how prevalent it is, it was not actually discovered until the 19th century. It was late in the 1800’s when it was discovered by the Dutch. After its discovery, it was researched for possible use as a source of protein. Though it was regarded as a possible food source and had sufficient nutritional properties, cultivating it in order to feed the masses after the food shortage and population boom, which took place shortly after the end of WWII, was determined to be uneconomic overall. Though these pursuits were abandoned, it was still cultivated for other specific uses, and more research resulted in more uses being discovered for this algae.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Chlorella are small enough to be considered microorganisms, and each individual microorganism contains the basic structure of a cell, including a nucleus, mitochondria, cell walls made up of cellulose for protection and to hold these components together along with starch grains and chloroplasts which are present in the cellular structure of most plants.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Why is Chlorella Algae Powder Popular Today?</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Popularity of Chlorella Algae still endures despite how old and difficult to cultivate it is. Why is this? This has to do with the adaptive history of Chlorella Algae. Because it is a freshwater plant, it had to adapt to survive periodic droughts that were very much a reality in the erratic weather patterns of the past 2 billion years. Therefore, it developed a fibrous shell around it which had two different important characteristics. It first allowed the cellular structure of the algae to be maintained as long as possible until the algae had been dried out beyond all hope. Secondly, and most importantly, this shell was used to absorb nutrients in the surrounding water to keep feeding the cell for as long as possible. This happened until the water was totally gone so that when the water returns, it is able to easily bounce back to full recovery.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It is this property that makes Chlorella Algae so useful to humans. This particular powder is called 'Chlorella Algae Broken Cell' because the outer shell has been cracked. This allows the nutrients within the algae to be more effectively absorbed while still providing the same benefits of the outer shell to the human body and digestive tract.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Chlorella Blue-Green Algae</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the most prominent health benefits of Chlorella Algae lies in its ability to detoxify the digestive tract. The outer shell of the Chlorella absorbs all of the toxic agents that are present in the digestive tract and detoxifies the intestines as it passes through. Not only that, but the insides of the algae are chock full of nutrients including Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Folic acid, Vitamin B2, Manganese, and Iodine.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Chlorella Algae helps to open up the arteries, increasing blood flow, and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen that makes it to muscle tissue and all of the important areas. It also synthesizes red blood cells to stimulate creation of new blood and the production of microscopic plant cultures within the intestine. These will continue to produce similar effects to Chlorella Algae without having to take the supplement all the time.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The question about the difference between Chlorella Algae and Spirulina Algae is often brought up since the two are very similar. The biggest difference is that Chlorella Algae have higher Iron content than Spirulina which can be a benefit or a drawback depending on the individual needs of the person taking it. Pregnant women often need to have higher Iron intake to make up for the amount being taken by their child. Older men also need more Iron in their diet to strengthen their bones. However, taking too much Iron can cause oxidation which puts greater pressure on the immune system to neutralize free radicals. It’s all about personal preference and what’s best for the person in question</p> ;332.12;CHLOR-10kg;http://www.bulksupplements.com/chlorella-blue-green-algae.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_368.jpg;;;<endrecord>

In addition, these BCAA's make up 40% of total body protein content and represent around 15 to 25 percent of total protein intake overall.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Leucine is the product of protein hydrolysis by way of various enzymes present in the pancreas. This reaction is part of the overall digestive process and is absolutely necessary in maintaining healthy growth levels in children and infants, as well as keeping regulated nitrogen levels in human adults. Valine is essential in maintaining the structure of various proteins that it has been incorporated into. Isoleucine is again, a chemical used to help stimulate the production and circulation of energy throughout the body. Each of these different amino acids is taken directly into the muscle during the metabolic process which makes them great candidates for muscle building for athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone else that might be routinely involved in strenuous physical activity.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs are found in their greatest natural quantities in products such as red meat and many types of dairy. Protein supplements synthesized from an egg base or from whey are ideal for finding high amounts of BCAA's. Isoleucine alone is found in just about every type of food, but particularly high amounts are usually seen in all types of meats including fish, and various cheeses. Leucine is found in more complex and refined sources of sustenance such as corn, yeast, brown rice, etc. Valine is usually found in flour, soy, mushrooms, peanuts, and meats.</p>   <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">As mentioned before, Branch Chain Amino Acids are used as supplements among a large community of athletes and body builder types because of their properties which help improve rates of muscle re-growth and increase general energy production. This means that once the workout is over there are less negative effects afterwards such as excessive tiredness and painful joints and muscles. These BCAAs are particularly important for muscles which are attached to the skeletal structure since they act as their primary source of fuel when they are taxed by long exercise sessions.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs, because of their relation and necessity to exercise are needed in higher quantities than any of the body’s other essential amino acids. They help in the building of muscle because they decrease the speed at which proteins break down while at the same time promoting their synthesis. They enter the body, and after going through the metabolic process, are turned into muscle tissue. Another way in which isoleucine is important to the body is because of its capacity to help maintain blood sugar levels along with energy levels, and in helping the healing process of bones, skin, and muscle tissue all over the body. Any healthy diet must take Isoleucine into account as it is one of the essential amino acids that is not naturally produced within the body. Leucine is essential because this BCAA is what keeps protein synthesis going on at a normal pace. Valine also helps in synthesis of Glucose, a process which takes place in the liver and is useful during any time in which anaerobic activity is taking place.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">BCAAs may reach the pinnacle of importance as far as the life of an athlete is concerned, but they are often sought out by those that desire to maintain generally good health because of their multiple uses and healthy properties. These amino acids are metabolized, not in the liver as with most other amino acids, but in the muscle tissue, making them take instant effect during strenuous exercise, which increases their popularity among athletes.

Another way in which isoleucine is important to the body is because of its capacity to help maintain blood sugar levels along with energy levels, and in helping the healing process of bones, skin, and muscle tissue all over the body. Any healthy diet must take Isoleucine into account as it is one of the essential amino acids that is not naturally produced within the body.

Creatine HCL Powder-250g Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Creatine works by increasing the amount of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) produced by the body by giving up a phosphate ion. This takes place during exercise which creates a high demand for energy, triggering this process. Once this occurs, the newly created ATP drives muscle contraction and then goes on to produce even more protein. Since this reaction is reversible, this also allows the Adenosine Diphosphate (the original form of Adenosine Triphosphate before Creatine donates an ion to it) to create more Creatine in the form of Phosphocreatine, a type of Creatine which can be stored in the muscles for later use.</p>  <h2 class="title" style="font-size:16px">HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CREATINE HCL</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Creatine HCL has been shown to help increase overall muscle mass as well as strength, as long as it is taken in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise.

Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Capsules-300 Gelatin Capsules;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking into account the wide spectrum of the most common kinds of nutrients, Vitamin C always seems to be the most popular. When it is ingested, it instantly goes to work circulating through all of the watery areas of the human body (once it has been absorbed into the intestines, of course) and from there, helps in the fortification of Collagen while acting as an antioxidant during the trip. Vitamin C is routinely used as a food additive along with other kinds of antioxidants like Calcium salts, Sodium, and Potassium. It is for this reason that the traditional Vitamin C supplements that can be bought in stores contain not only Ascorbic Acid, but many other types of Ascorbates that fit a similar purpose.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C also has a host of other general uses. It assists in the repair of damaged tissue, in keeping up healthy levels of Collagen\; and in conjunction with equally essential insoluble compounds, such as Vitamin E. Vitamin C helps these become generally more effective at what they already accomplish for the body.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>IS THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE VITAMIN C THE BIOACTIVE FORM L-ASCORBIC ACID?</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">There has been some concern due to shady business tactics from a variety of companies that the generally available forms of Vitamin C may not be as active as would generally be desired. Well, you should feel relieved to know that this is no longer a practice that is followed by any company. Worldwide, the stock of Vitamin C on all store shelves is the bioactive form L-Ascorbic Acid.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY ASCORBIC ACID POWDER</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C is most well known for its usefulness in conjunction with other enzymes and solutions. This widens the usefulness of Vitamin C considerably more from its already essential position. It is a necessary ingredient in the building of tissue, in the protection and fortification of the immune system, in Collagen strengthening, in the synthesizing of Carnitine (which is the first step in the process of cellular metabolism), and in helping to maintain bone and teeth structure. It also helps convert Tetrahydrofolic acid from Folacin.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Of course it should go without saying at this point that Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant. Much like Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), Vitamin C is also useful in the neutralization of harmful free radical molecules, and it also helps to police any threatening activity that may be occurring in any of the watery parts of the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Not only does Vitamin C help in the fortification of Collagen, it is actually an essential building block of this type of protein tissue. Collagen can be found throughout all parts of the body and it is what controls our body’s level of flexibility to an extent, while also strengthening blood vessels, teeth, gums, cartilage, vertebrae, etc. Vitamin C is even essential in healing minor wounds and cuts through its Collagen production.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Vitamin C is an immune system stimulant and modulator.

D-Mannose Powder-5kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">The lining of the bladder has probe-like protrusions that are a target for bacteria such as E-coli. This bacterium causes about 90% of urine infections, as well as Cystitis. The bacterium attaches itself to the bladder wall, hence causing urinary infections. The use of D-Mannose powder attracts the E-coli bug which removes it from the bladder wall. The bug is then effectively expelled when you urinate, leaving the bladder clear of any infection. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Many people prefer D-Mannose as an alternative to antibiotics as it does not randomly kill all bacteria, but will flush out the E-coli bug during urination. Regular drugs tend to eliminate not only harmful bacteria, but good bacteria on the gastrointestinal tract as well. This eliminates good bacteria that are required to maintain optimal health.

Phenibut-25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Phenibut was discovered in Russia by scientists who were looking for an alternative tranquilizing drug for cosmonauts to prevent anxiety, stress and panic without causing drowsiness. Although the traditional sedatives still assert their efficacy in relieving stress and anxiety and panic, they make the cosmonauts drowsy which are not acceptable to them as they need to stay awake while traveling in space. Phenibut became their drug of choice and was in fact made part of the cosmonaut's kit in one of their space missions. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Phenibut is obtained from Gamma Amino Butyric Acid or GABA, a major neurotransmitter in the body. The only difference these two chemical compounds have is Phenibut contains a phenyl ring that has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier easily penetrating the brain in a matter of minutes. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Phenibut, whose name comes from ß-Phenyl-?-aminobutyric acid, also has the ability to relieve insomnia symptoms and to reduce stress. </p>   <h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY PHENIBUT</h2> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Phenibut relieves anxiety and panic. The calming and tranquilizing effect of Phenibut has been lauded and acclaimed by users in their favorable reviews in online forums. These properties and its added attribute of preventing drowsiness made it the drug of choice of cosmonauts in a space mission launched by Russia in the 60's. </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Phenibut enhances the effects of sleeping pills, sedatives and narcotics. Phenibut has the ability to potentiate or make these drugs more potent and effective to users.  </p> ;1976.61;PNBT-25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/phenibut-25kg-pure-powder.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/p/h/phenibut_2.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Glycine Powder-20kg Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Glycine</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glycine is necessary in reactions that help to form peptides, adenosine triphosphate, nucleic acids, bile acids, proteins, hemoglobin, glucose and other types of amino acids and essential nutrients. The body would not be able to make proper use of the benefits of glucose without Glycine. Glucose can also be found in high concentrations throughout the spinal cord because it inhibits certain neurotransmitters.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Not only does it inhibit some neurotransmitters, it also helps others which are responsible for cognition and memory in the brain. Glycine may also block the passage of certain toxins attempting to enter the system, rendering them less harmful before they reach their destination.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">In its ability to make energy out of glucose, Glycine also assists in the synthesis of stomach bile. This process helps the digestive system dissolve foods into usable nutrients and break down fats. For this reason, Glycine can be found in many antacids. </p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Glycine can be made directly from the synthesis of choline that takes place in the kidneys and liver. It also has the ability to be derived from another amino acid called serine, but can be transformed back into serine under the right conditions. </p>;117.99;L-GLY20KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-glycine.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_122.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Choline L-Bitartrate Powder-100g Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Choline L-Bitartrate</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Compounds classified as lipotropic are important to stable liver function, as they have the capability of converting fats transported there into energy.

Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract -20kg Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Ginkgo Biloba Powdered Extract</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Ginkgo Biloba is such a powerful healer because it contains both flavonoids and terpenoids. These each have strong antioxidant properties that help fight harmful free radicals that go throughout the body hurting healthy cells. These molecules can be found in the body naturally from exposure to various toxins like pollution, food and cigarette smoke. Without antioxidants, they are hard to get rid of. These free radicals have the potential to alter DNA and kill cells, which makes them responsible for a whole host of other health problems. The important point is that antioxidants can stop them.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">This extract is believed to assist with mood, memory loss, headaches and other issues associated with reduced blood flow to the brain and body. It has been used to treat depression and Lyme disease as well.</p>;623.99;GINK-20KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/ginkgo-biloba-leaf-extract-24.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_4_14.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Niacin (Vitamin B3)-20kg Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Niacin</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the most important roles of Niacin is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins, hence the reason that Niacin is often found in such high stores in the liver, the detoxification center of the body. It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. </p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">The body is often in great need of Niacin, and being able to provide ideal levels can be difficult without correct dietary scheduling. Niacin also blocks fats from making their way into the blood stream to some extent. In addition, taking Niacin at about 20mg per day or more has been shown in many scientific tests to increase overall metabolism. However, taking too much Niacin over time can cause a slowdown or stoppage of the body’s breakdown of fats.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Niacin is an excellent supplement for vegetarians, vegans and people who frequently consume alcohol. This is because diets that are low on meat are also low on Niacin, since some of the largest stores come from tryptophan. Niacin deficiency is actually quite prevalent among Americans, with symptoms including dementia, canker sores, gastrointestinal problems, low blood sugar, muscle tension and pains, inflammation of the skin, insomnia, fatigue, digestion problems and a whole host of other problems. Pellagra is a fatal disease which is often associated with extreme Niacin deficiency in the diet. This can result in debilitating mental issues, skin problems and additional gastrointestinal symptoms if left untreated. The best way to prevent this from occurring is to keep up Niacin levels in the body.</p> ;280.53;NIA-20KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/niacin-usp.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/a/m/amazonbag_18.png;;;<endrecord>

Citric Acid Crystalized Powder-50 lbs Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CITRIC ACID</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Citric Acid is notable for being a component of the Citric Acid cycle, a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidization of acetate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Also known as E330, Citric Acid is a normal component of human cells that is metabolized, degraded and eliminated from the body. It is one of the main ingredients in the food and beverage industry because it is easily obtained in large quantities, healthy and cheap. It is often used for proper mineral supplementation of food, as an acidity regulator and as a flavor compound. Citric Acid enhances the activity of many beneficial antioxidants, but is not, itself, an antioxidant.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">This product is also used for its health benefits in food, alcohol and insecticide production as well. It is the most frequently used preservative in the world today. The lemon salt has been used for centuries to conserve meat and fish. It increases the acidity of the bacterial environment, making it difficult for it and the microbes to survive and, most importantly, to reproduce. It is called lemon salt because it was first extracted from a lemon. </p> ;71.35;CRA-50LBS;http://www.bulksupplements.com/citric-acid.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/a/m/amazonbag_25.png;;;<endrecord>

Casein Protein contains branch chain amino acids (BCAA’s) and assists in the recovery of muscles after strenuous physical activity. Supplementation of micellar protein also helps the general development of lean muscle mass at a faster rate. In addition to its high protein content, one serving of Casein contains almost half of the daily recommended value of Calcium, which can promote healthy bones as well. </p> ;281.95;CASEP20KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/casein-protein-powder.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_2_22_1.jpg;;;<endrecord>

This protein powder is a rich source of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), essential amino acids that are largely found in muscle tissues and used primarily in the production of proteins and in enhancing physical performance. Leucine is the branched-chain amino acid that is primarily responsible for initiating protein synthesis in the body.

Consuming Whey Protein Isolate in its pure form where a large percentage of fats have been removed can help maintain a lean body. The difference among these three forms of Whey Protein lies in their manner of filtration. Microfiltration and ion exchange methods have been used in the production of Whey Protein Isolate. It is completely free of cholesterol, lactose carbohydrates and fats.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify\;"> Whey Protein Isolate is good for people suffering from lactose intolerance. Unlike Whey Protein Concentrate and Whey Protein Hydrolysate, Whey Protein Isolate contains a very small amount of lactose or none at all, as this has been removed with the fat.  </p>;224.70;WPISO20KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/whey-protein-isolate-90.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/a/m/amazonbag_54.png;;;<endrecord>

This makes it ideal for athletes who wish to burn fat and enhance muscle mass. In some cases, CLA has been shown to reduce feelings of hunger as well.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">CLA has also been attributed to a reduction of food allergies and the lowering of high blood pressure. Although people have used it for a number of other reasons, most studies do not have sufficient evidence to prove its effectiveness for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of cancer. </p>;98.91;CLA6000;http://www.bulksupplements.com/cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgel-1000mg.html;in stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/a/m/amazonbag_108.png;;;<endrecord>
Fish Oil Softgel (1000mg)-6000 Softgels;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided By Fish Oil (High Omega 3) EPA/DHA</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">These Omega-3 fatty acids are the building blocks of Eicosanoids, which are useful in their ability to reduce inflammation throughout the entire body. Fish Oil also helps maintain generally high levels of strong cardiovascular health.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">This supplement is extracted from the tissues of fish with exceptionally oily bodily content such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, halibut, cod liver and herring. These fish develop this oil in their bodies when they eat micro-algae, which helps in the synthesis of these acids.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are Omega-3 fatty acids present in other sources too, such as Flaxseed oil and Soybean oil, but these come in the form of Alpha-Linolenic Acid. These oils must go through a conversion process in order to reach the state of DHA and EPA\; this process causes most of the benefits brought on by these two fatty acids to be lost in interim, bringing limited benefit. Not only that, but as we age, the body becomes less capable of performing this conversion process. This is why Fish Oil is a much better source of Omega-3 fatty acids.

Folic Acid (Vitamin B9) Powder-25kg Pure Powder;;<h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Folic Acid</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Folic Acid also facilitates the conversion of S-Adenosylmethionine into Glutathione, which helps in the detoxification of the liver. Due to the importance of Folic Acid, the FDA actually requires foods such as bread, corn meal, rice, pasta, noodles and other grainy foods to be fortified with certain concentrations of Folic Acid. When Folic Acid is being consumed, it is best taken in tandem with Vitamin B12 or Vitamin C in order to facilitate more effective break down and creation of new proteins for later use.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking Folic Acid before and during pregnancy is highly recommended and very important to having a healthy child. Not only do doctors prescribe Folic Acid supplements routinely for pregnant women, but they also recommend eating foods high in Folic Acid content. Anyone that is deficient in Folic Acid will eventually experience health problems as a result.</p> ;1142.71;FOLIC25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/folic-acid-vitamin-b9-powder-25kg-pure-powder.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media//catalog/product/placeholder/default/BulkSupplementsBag1200.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Inositol Nicotinate Powder-25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">This compound is a version of Inositol which has been changed into an ester by Niacin. Niacin is very important itself as a vitamin and it contains associations with the saying “Niacin flush” because taking one causes the speed of blood flowing throughout the body to increase substantially via its ability to dilate the blood vessels. This procedure known as flushing can have various side effects that go along with it such as a tingling sensation felt at various parts of the body, patches of warm red skin, sweating, increased hear rate, chills, dizziness, feeling out of breath, and even fainting. Taking Inositol Hexanicotinate is preferable to doing a normal Niacin flush because it allows this same dilation to occur without any of the negative side effects that go along with it.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Inositol Hexanicotinate As Well As Niacin</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Taking Niacin at about 20mg per day or more has been shown in many scientific tests to increase overall metabolism. Taking too much Niacin can over time cause a slowdown or stoppage of the body’s breakdown of fats.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Niacin is an excellent supplement for vegetarians, vegans, and people who frequently consume alcohol. This is because diets that are low on meat are also low on Niacin since some of the largest stores of Niacin come from Tryptophan. Also, taking too much alcohol can inhibit the body’s ability to correctly absorb Niacin. Therefore these demographics may benefit from taking an additional Niacin supplement to help even out their dietary lack of Vitamin B3. Niacin deficiency is actually quiet prevalent among Americans, with symptoms including dementia, canker sores, gastrointestinal problems, low blood sugar, muscle tension and pains, inflammation of the skin, insomnia, fatigue, digestion problems, dizziness, headaches, and a whole host of other problems. Pellagra is a fatal disease which is often associated with extreme Niacin deficiency in the diet which can result in debilitating mental issues, skin problems and additional gastrointestinal symptoms if left untreated. The best way to prevent this from occurring is to keep up Niacin levels in the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">An additional positive effect of Inositol Hexanicotinate is that is helps support functioning of the liver.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Niacin’s Purpose</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Of all of the B vitamins, Niacin is considered to be one of the most stable. It is water soluble and it is vital in sustaining life. It resists the effects of those elements which may cause erosion such as wind, heat, light, alkali, and acids. Its appearance is in the form of white powder with crystalline grains. Both Niacinamide and Niacin are soluble in alcohol and water, and are quite rapidly absorbed into the digestive system once consumed. The body is often wont to store extra amounts of these vitamins within the liver\; however the majority of it is usually expelled during urination.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">One of the most important roles of Niacin is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins, hence the term “flush.” It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. These reactions include, but are not limited to processes which strengthen cell integrity and also produce energy for the body to use, meaning that without Niacin, the body would operate much more slowly, would be much weaker, and would also not be able to build many energy reserves. Through this indirect influence it helps the production of DNA, in the breakdown and metabolizing of fats, and in the general maturation of each individual cell.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">The body is often in great need of Niacin, and being able to provide this level of Niacin can be difficult without correct dietary scheduling. Foods that are high in protein are a great source of Niacin because the body can later convert amino acids such as Tryptophan (one that is found in high stores in turkey) into Niacin.</p>    ;706.67;INONIC25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/inositol-nicotinate-powder-25kg-pure-powder.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media//catalog/product/placeholder/default/BulkSupplementsBag1200.jpg;;;<endrecord>

Magnesium D-Aspartate Powder-25kg Pure Powder;;<p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium L-aspartate is one of the most easily absorbed types of magnesium supplement available. It goes down very smoothly too, as opposed to certain other forms which may cause diarrhea if used slightly in excess. Magnesium is one of the most important minerals in the body, thus making magnesium L-aspartate a great way for the body to replenish low levels of magnesium without being too demanding. Since magnesium is needed for at least three hundred different bodily reactions to take place, it is quite necessary to maintain high levels of it. Because this form of magnesium is so readily absorbed, it is considered one of the most powerful magnesium based supplements.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium is a requirement in the synthesis of various chemicals such as nucleic acid, fat, protein, etc. It assists in the body’s ability to make use of glucose and is important in the process of transferring energy throughout the body due to its relation to glucose. It keeps the heart healthy by dilating the arteries and blood vessels to an acceptable level. Without magnesium, blood vessels in the body may begin to shrink and cause blood flow throughout the body to be stymied dangerously. Magnesium also helps keep up levels of oral health and immune system efficiency.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium can be found in a wide variety of foods, including beans, nuts, grains, green vegetables especially of the leafy variety, and many types of seafood just to name a few nonspecific areas. Unfortunately, even though magnesium is found in so many different foods, contemporary diets do not have much room for these specific kinds of foods so it may be prudent to supplement if this is the case for you personally.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">There are a few different groups of people that are at a higher risk for suffering magnesium deficiency. This list includes the elderly, people that use diuretics excessively, and diabetics. Women who take “the pill” as a form of contraception are a part of this overarching group to. Many people in these groups could benefit greatly from magnesium supplementation to increase overall bodily health.</p>  <h2 class="title" style=>Health Benefits Provided by Magnesium L-Aspartate 12%</h2>  <p style="text-align: justify\;">Magnesium is an absolutely essential nutrient and acts as a cofactor in around three hundred different bodily reactions. Magnesium is necessary to be present in the body in order for ATP, the chemical which promotes energy production and storage, to function correctly. It is also needed in order for proteins to work correctly and for muscles to maintain functionality. Not only that, but magnesium is important in the formation of bones and teeth. It helps the body produce the necessary amount of insulin, keeps the heart beating at a steady pace, and facilitates the breakdown of various proteins to be used by the body.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">If you remain unconvinced of magnesium’s benefits, there are many negative symptoms associated with magnesium deficiency. These include nausea, low blood pressure, confusion, muscle spasm, insomnia, slow nail growth, seizure, difficulty breathing, sleep disorders, general irritability, and restless leg syndrome.</p> <p style="text-align: justify\;">It has also been shown that the efficiency of magnesium supplementation increases greatly when taking calcium supplements along with it. For best results it is recommended that magnesium be consumed at a 1:2 ratio with calcium. This is because magnesium indirectly controls the enzyme which allows calcium to be absorbed correctly. Therefore without high levels of magnesium, not only will a magnesium deficiency be suffered, but a calcium deficiency as well.</p>  ;706.67;MAGDAP25KG;http://www.bulksupplements.com/magnesium-d-aspartate-powder-25kg-pure-powder.html;out of stock;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media//catalog/product/placeholder/default/BulkSupplementsBag1200.jpg;;;<endrecord>
