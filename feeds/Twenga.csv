It is naturally produced by the human body in the kidneys and liver and is derived from the two essential amino acids, Methionine and Lysine. The body uses Acetyl-L-Carnitine to assist in oxidizing fatty acids. In simpler terms, this means that this ALCAR is used to help convert the fatty acids found in food into an exhaustible energy source, that in turn fuels the body. This works because ALCAR is the main vehicle that assists in the transference of these fatty acids to the mitochondrial membrane of each local cell where this oxidization routinely happens. ALCAR can be found in larger deposits near the areas of the body that most actively break down fatty acids on a regular basis, including those muscles that control the skeleton and the heart.</p>";"ALCAR-5KG";"Y";"4974";"1";"0"

The structure of its chemical makeup is very similar to Choline, a related chemical.  Dimethglycine is part of the B-chain of vitamins, and thus is given the name Vitamin B-15. It is also known to be called Pangamic Acid and can be useful in reducing recovery time after difficult exercise and also improving the body’s ability to intake and use oxygen. Similar to the effects of Betaine, Dimethylglycine is able to donate a methyl towards necessary enzymatic reactions. This ability to donate one of its methyl's is very crucial in the synthesis and production of important brain chemicals. Decent levels of Glycine in the body are responsible for a general overall feeling of health or well being.</p>";"DMG-CAP-100VC";"Y";"92";"1";"0"

Most water soluble nutrients and vitamins are usually quickly expelled through the urinary tract, making Vitamin B12 fairly unique in this regard.
