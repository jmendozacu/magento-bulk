Due to the association that ALCAR has with the specific acetyl group that it belongs to, it is known for the great variety of benefits it provides to general brain functions and mental health. In fact, Alpha Lipoic Acid, another type of acid found within the body that works in tandem with ALCAR has recently been discovered to have immense benefits when broken down in conjunction with the aforementioned ALCAR. Once again, because of its level of concentration, it is much easier for the system to absorb ALCAR than its base relative, L-Carnitine. It is this very attribute of ALCAR that makes it such an effective type of antioxidant.  BENEFITS PROVIDED BY Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)  Once again, one of the major health benefits associated with Acetyl-L-Carnitine is its efficiency in breaking down fatty acids and turning them into a useable energy source to fuel the body. In this sense it helps regulate human metabolism at a basic cellular level. Even though the body regularly produces acceptable amounts of ALCAR all by itself, taking additional supplements can still greatly speed up the speed of this cellular metabolism process, thereby resulting in more energy conserved, less energy wasted. During this process of energy production, Carnitines are also known for being able to assist in the removal of waste products from the system\; another reason that these are produced by the liver, an organ which is known for acting as a kind of filter. Generally the body of a healthy person will relegate the kidneys towards managing healthy levels of Carnitines, but bodies afflicted with any sort of kidney disease and in some cases other types of cardiovascular illnesses will result in significantly reduced levels of Carnitines.  ACETYL-L-CARNITINE AND ALPHA LIPOIC ACID  When these two acids are combined, the result is a synergistic effect which allows the mental power and generally everyday brain functions of a person to become much more focused and enhanced. Each of these compounds has properties which assist the brain on their own, but when combined the effect is magnified to even greater proportions. It is because of this that the two are generally found blended together in the various products. Alpha Lipoic Acid is another enzyme which is naturally occurring on its own because it is so important in the process of cellular metabolism. Its usefulness when blended with ALCAR becomes clear in a few different ways. For one, it is able to greatly speed up the transportation of Glucose to muscle tissue resulting in a greater sense of both speed and endurance in the body. Secondly, it allows a greater breadth of fatty acid content to actually be consumed during the metabolizing process so that less weight is gained and more energy is provided to the body. While the powder itself may be a bit off-putting to the taste, here these supplements can be found in proportional amounts contained within capsules so that the slight burning sensation that occurs when the substances hit the tongue need not be endured.;BulkSupplements;ALCAR-100;;;0.2200;

It also helps in maintaining good levels of blood sugar, hormones, and keeps the immune system functioning well. Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because though the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells, and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins. Urea is needed in order for the body to expel Ammonia through the urine however\; urea would not be manufactured without Arginine. Arginine is also helpful in releasing insulin when necessary and in creating and facilitating the creation of important hormones. Arginine helps to stop the restriction of blood flow throughout the body. It allows blood vessels to relax rather than be constricted, dilating them so that there is better flow of oxygen throughout the body.   Health Benefits Provided by L-Arginine HCL  There are many different foods which contain L-Arginine including soy products, barley, almonds and other nuts, raisins, types of cereal, meats, oats, and wheat products including flour. These are all major sources of Arginine.  There are some conditions which cause people to not be able to accumulate or produce enough Arginine. If you happen to have one such condition, Arginine supplementation is the best alternative for you. Also, those who are interested in maintaining strict levels of exercise should keep up their levels of Arginine. Arginine can be found in high concentrations in the skin. Muscles and connective tissues are also supported by the presence of Arginine in the blood. Creatine and nitrogen supplements are generally taken by body builders and exercise enthusiasts because of their ability to create energy and enhance muscle mass respectively. However, the strength and effectiveness of these supplements is determined by Arginine\; because without this amino acid, it would be impossible for the body to process these other elements, making Arginine just as important for exercise as either of the other two.;BulkSupplements;L-ARGHCL-100;;;0.2200;

Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because although the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins.

Amino acids as a group, are very important in all aspects of maintaining the physical body, especially in the building of muscles and in synthesizing proteins. Generally, Alanine is considered an nonessential acid\; so if you are a healthy person that maintains average health and an average level of physical activity, supplementation and consumption of foods containing Alanine is unnecessary as the body produces enough of its own. Alanine helps to keep the body’s levels of Nitrogen and Glucose balanced. When Glucose is broken down it creates a byproduct known as Pyruvate. When the Alanine cycle occurs, this causes all excess amino acids found in the bodily tissues to be transferred to that Pyruvate receptor molecule. Thus, the Pyruvate molecule is then turned into Alanine and makes its way to the liver. There, the liver extracts a quantity of nitrogen from the Alanine\; converting a portion back into Pyruvate, where the process can then be utilized in the production of Glucose once more. The nitrogen is then used to help the liver perform its natural functions. This cycle continues to perpetuate itself in a healthy body. Alanine is able to use blood sugar as energy, and then give back to that pool of blood sugar through its indirect relation to the production and processing of Glucose as well as other amino acids. Alanine can be found naturally in many different dietary locations including meat, beans, seafood, yeast, brown rice bran, dairy, nuts, corn, gelatin, and other whole grains.   Health Benefits Provided by L-Alanine  Alanine is a provider of energy to muscle, the nervous system, and the brain. It helps to support the immune system and it also helps to metabolize acids and sugars that come from organic sources. Since Alanine is essential in the production of energy, this makes it popular to supplement among athletes. During exercise routines that are more strenuous, L-Alanine is distributed rapidly throughout the body into areas like the muscles. This makes it perfect to take L-Alanine right before a big workout so that the muscles can be provided with a large source of energy right from the start, allowing the routine to last much longer.   Alanine keeps toxins from being released during the breakdown of muscles (which occurs every time a real exercise regimen has been going on for some time) so that muscles are free to regrow and repair without having to worry about all of the terrible toxins being released as a result of that muscle building exercise. Alanine is usually derived from diets that have a standard amount of protein in them. However, if for any reason you happen to have a very low protein diet it would be best to take an Alanine supplement. Alanine helps keep levels of blood sugar up even during intense exercise. Since low blood sugar is linked directly to fatigue it is believed that alanine can prevent exercisers from becoming fatigued prematurely. ;BulkSupplements;L-ALA-100;;;0.2200;

Amino acids as a group, are very important in all aspects of maintaining the physical body, especially in the building of muscles and in synthesizing proteins. Generally, Alanine is considered an nonessential acid\; so if you are a healthy person that maintains average health and an average level of physical activity, supplementation and consumption of foods containing Alanine is unnecessary as the body produces enough of its own. Alanine helps to keep the body’s levels of Nitrogen and Glucose balanced. When Glucose is broken down it creates a byproduct known as Pyruvate. When the Alanine cycle occurs, this causes all excess amino acids found in the bodily tissues to be transferred to that Pyruvate receptor molecule. Thus, the Pyruvate molecule is then turned into Alanine and makes its way to the liver. There, the liver extracts a quantity of nitrogen from the Alanine\; converting a portion back into Pyruvate, where the process can then be utilized in the production of Glucose once more. The nitrogen is then used to help the liver perform its natural functions. This cycle continues to perpetuate itself in a healthy body. Alanine is able to use blood sugar as energy, and then give back to that pool of blood sugar through its indirect relation to the production and processing of Glucose as well as other amino acids. Alanine can be found naturally in many different dietary locations including meat, beans, seafood, yeast, brown rice bran, dairy, nuts, corn, gelatin, and other whole grains.   Health Benefits Provided by L-Alanine  Alanine is a provider of energy to muscle, the nervous system, and the brain. It helps to support the immune system and it also helps to metabolize acids and sugars that come from organic sources. Since Alanine is essential in the production of energy, this makes it popular to supplement among athletes. During exercise routines that are more strenuous, L-Alanine is distributed rapidly throughout the body into areas like the muscles. This makes it perfect to take L-Alanine right before a big workout so that the muscles can be provided with a large source of energy right from the start, allowing the routine to last much longer.   Alanine keeps toxins from being released during the breakdown of muscles (which occurs every time a real exercise regimen has been going on for some time) so that muscles are free to regrow and repair without having to worry about all of the terrible toxins being released as a result of that muscle building exercise. Alanine is usually derived from diets that have a standard amount of protein in them. However, if for any reason you happen to have a very low protein diet it would be best to take an Alanine supplement. Alanine helps keep levels of blood sugar up even during intense exercise. Since low blood sugar is linked directly to fatigue it is believed that alanine can prevent exercisers from becoming fatigued prematurely. ;BulkSupplements;L-ALA-1KG;;;2.2050;

BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;Glycine - 100g Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/l-glycine.html;L-GLY-100;11.85;;men, women;849720003454;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_124.jpg;Being a nonessential acid not only means that the body is able to manufacture Glycine on its own\; it also implies that the body is able to manufacture enough of it on its own, that little outside supplementation or consumption of Glycine is needed by most people. Glycine can be made directly from the synthesis of Choline that takes place in the kidneys and liver. It also has the ability to be derived from another amino acid called Serine, but can be transformed back into Serine under the right conditions. This process allows the body to detoxify the liver, as well as the manufacture bile to assist the digestive system. Glycine is often taken with Creatine because it boosts the effectiveness of the Creatine. This creates a reaction which builds muscle mass at an accelerated rate while at the same time, continually supplying the body with new energy, storing some of that energy for use later. Glycine can also be found in the skin, in various tissues, and in Collagen, which helps to keep the skin flexible and well rooted to the bones and other tissues. Glycine may also be used as a type of sweetener in some foods because of its somewhat sweet taste.  Health Benefits Provided by Glycine  Glycine is necessary in reactions that help to form peptides, purines, Adenosine Triphosphate, nucleic acids, bile acids, proteins, Glutathione, Creatine, bile salts, porphyrins, Hemoglobin, Glucose, and other types of amino acids and essential nutrients. There is a hormone known as Glucagon which is able to convert Glycine into Glucose. This hormone can then be used by the body to fulfill certain energy needs. It is Glycine which stimulates this hormone into action in the first place\; allowing the Glucose to be released once the conversion has taken place, which in turn will let that energy flow. The body would not be able to make proper use of the benefits of Glucose without Glycine. Glucose can also be found in high concentrations throughout the spinal cord because it inhibits certain signals, or neurotransmitters. It doesn’t only inhibit some neurotransmitters, it also helps others which are responsible for cognition and memory in the brain. Glycine may also block the passage of certain toxins attempting to enter the system, converting them to something more harmless before they reach their goal.;BulkSupplements;L-GLY-100;;;0.2200;

For so many decades, EDTA has been very important in the treatment of vascular diseases by itself or in combination with other forms of treatment for this purpose. EDTA may also be effective in the treatment of heart disease. This conclusion was made when patients who were being treated with EDTA for lead poisoning showed signs that their Angina Pectoris was also cured. EDTA is also used to complement the application of the preservative used in the manufacture of eye drops and other eye preparations. EDTA Calcium Disodium is also popular among Endodontists, as they use it to clean and lubricate the tooth canals as preparation for a tooth canal procedure.  Improvements in the case of critical Limb Ischemia, as well as the potential for the treatment of Macular Degeneration have been reported and considered for further research.   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY EDTA CALCIUM DISODIUM EDTA Calcium Disodium has the ability to cleanse the body of toxic metals it has accumulated from various sources. Infusion of intravenous EDTA chemical directly to the veins in a process called Chelation Therapy, will greatly benefit the patient who is suffering from diseases such as metal poisoning, cardiovascular diseases and Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease.  EDTA Calcium Disodium rids the body of harmful metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Iron. It is believed to remove aluminum, an element that is associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease. It is also used to cleanse the body of excess iron and copper.  EDTA is used to protect the body from heart disease by preventing the accumulation of plaque in the arterial walls.  ;BulkSupplements;EDTACD-25KG;;;55.1160;

These amino acids are very important and of absolute necessity when it comes to sustaining good health. Just about every neurotransmitter in the body as well as about 95% of all hormones in the body are made up of amino acids. Once consumed, the body combines DL-Methionine with ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) where they goes on to produce SAMe. This is a requirement of at least forty different biochemical reactions that are necessary towards sustaining life, and it is also indirectly present in a lot more. The reason that the body needs Methionine is that it helps produce Cysteine and Taurine\; which help to support the cardiovascular system, build up healthy tissue, and get rid of bad bodily toxins. The body also uses these sulfur compounds to help develop the hair, nails, and skin. Sulfur also aids the kidneys in getting rid of metallic toxins present in there.  Methionine is what is known as a Lipotropic, which means that it helps the liver in rapidly processing fats. Chemicals also a part of the Lipotropic group are Inositol, Betaine, and Choline, which each help out the liver in one way or another. It also helps to support the production of Glutathione, which helps to further detoxify the liver.

A human being will not be able to survive if these amino acids are not produced and consumed regularly. They are referred to as branch chain amino acids because they have a chemical structure which separates them from the rest of the amino acid family that are also considered essential. In addition, these BCAA's make up 40% of total body protein content and represent around 15 to 25 percent of total protein intake overall. Leucine is the product of protein hydrolysis by way of various enzymes present in the pancreas. This reaction is part of the overall digestive process and is absolutely necessary in maintaining healthy growth levels in children and infants, as well as keeping regulated nitrogen levels in human adults. Valine is essential in maintaining the structure of various proteins that it has been incorporated into. Isoleucine is again, a chemical used to help stimulate the production and circulation of energy throughout the body. Each of these different amino acids is taken directly into the muscle during the metabolic process which makes them great candidates for muscle building for athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone else that might be routinely involved in strenuous physical activity. BCAAs are found in their greatest natural quantities in products such as red meat and many types of dairy. Protein supplements synthesized from an egg base or from whey are ideal for finding high amounts of BCAA's. Isoleucine alone is found in just about every type of food, but particularly high amounts are usually seen in all types of meats including fish, and various cheeses. Leucine is found in more complex and refined sources of sustenance such as corn, yeast, brown rice, etc. Valine is usually found in flour, soy, mushrooms, peanuts, and meats.   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS  As mentioned before, branch chain amino acids are used as supplements among a large community of athletes and body builder types because of their properties which help improve rates of muscle re-growth and increase general energy production. This means that once the workout is over there are less negative effects afterwards such as excessive tiredness and painful joints and muscles. These BCAAs are particularly important for muscles which are attached to the skeletal structure since they act as their primary source of fuel when they are taxed by long exercise sessions. BCAAs, because of their relation and necessity to exercise are needed in higher quantities than any of the body’s other essential amino acids. They help in the building of muscle because they decrease the speed at which proteins break down while at the same time promoting their synthesis. They enter the body, and after going through the metabolic process, are turned into muscle tissue. Another way in which isoleucine is important to the body is because of its capacity to help maintain blood sugar levels along with energy levels, and in helping the healing process of bones, skin, and muscle tissue all over the body. Any healthy diet must take Isoleucine into account as it is one of the essential amino acids that is not naturally produced within the body. Leucine is essential because this BCAA is what keeps protein synthesis going on at a normal pace. Valine also helps in synthesis of glucose, a process which takes place in the liver and is useful during any time in which anaerobic activity is taking place. BCAAs may reach the pinnacle of importance as far as the life of an athlete is concerned, but they are often sought out by those that desire to maintain generally good health because of their multiple uses and healthy properties. These amino acids are metabolized, not in the liver as with most other amino acids, but in the muscle tissue, making them take instant effect during strenuous exercise, which increases their popularity among athletes. Even the smallest amount of exercise can lower levels of BCAAs, leading to feelings of exhaustion over a short time. For anyone interested in maintaining a comprehensive exercise regimen over a long period of time, BCAAs represent a great supplement to maintain this level of activity while minimizing the side effects caused by exhaustion.;BulkSupplements;BCAA-100;;;0.2200;

In addition, it indirectly helps to widen the blood vessels via L-Carnosine, which increases blood flow during long bouts of physical activity.   The Difference between L Carnosine and Beta Alanine  Taking into account the similarities between the two and the overlap associated with both of them, one may wonder why they should bother taking Beta Alanine when L-Carnosine is a viable supplement as well. Well essentially, the problem that makes L-Carnosine less viable as a direct supplement, is that it is broken down by the body too quickly in smaller doses. It would be necessary to take much larger quantities of L-Carnosine at once to provide the same effectiveness that would come with taking a much smaller and more manageable amount of Beta Alanine. Since Beta Alanine is eventually broken down into a more sustainable and controllable amount of L-Carnosine anyway, it makes more sense to stick with Beta Alanine as your main supplement.;BulkSupplements;BA-100;;;0.2200;

Since Beta Alanine is eventually broken down into a more sustainable and controllable amount of L-Carnosine anyway, it makes more sense to stick with Beta Alanine as your main supplement.;BulkSupplements;BA-250;;;0.5510;

It also helps in maintaining good levels of blood sugar, hormones, and keeps the immune system functioning well. Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because although the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells\; and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins. Urea is needed in order for the body to expel Ammonia through the urine, however, urea would not be manufactured without Arginine. Arginine is also helpful in releasing insulin when necessary and in creating and facilitating the creation of important hormones. Arginine helps to stop the restriction of blood flow throughout the body. It allows blood vessels to relax rather than be constricted, dilating them so that there is better flow of oxygen throughout the body. Pyroglutamate is another amino acid which can be found in fruit, dairy, meat, and vegetable sources. Health Benefits Provided by L-Arginine L-Pyroglutamate  There are many different foods which contain L-Arginine including soy products, barley, almonds and other nuts, raisins, types of cereal, meats, oats, and wheat products including flour. These are all major sources of Arginine.  There are some conditions which cause people to not be able to accumulate or produce enough Arginine. If you happen to have one such condition, Arginine supplementation is the best alternative for you. Also, those who are interested in maintaining strict levels of exercise should keep up their levels of Arginine, as it is able to produce a chemical which causes a great increase in the amount of oxygen flowing through to the necessary areas in the body. Arginine can be found in high concentrations in the skin. Muscles and connective tissues are also supported by the presence of Arginine in the blood. Creatine and nitrogen supplements are generally taken by body builders and exercise enthusiasts because of their ability to create energy and enhance muscle mass respectively.

It keeps the production of antibodies up which makes the immune system stronger. It also helps to directly eliminate toxins in cells and heightens the concentration of NADH in the brain, which correlates to having a better memory. Aspartic Acid is particularly well known for getting rid of Ammonia, which has been linked to nervous system damage and liver damage as well. Aspartic Acid is found in its highest concentrations in meat products, sugar cane, and in molasses. Aspartame is a popular alternative sweetener that is derived from Aspartic Acid.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Aspartic Acid  This supplement helps to rid the body of Ammonia which can be very damaging to healthy cells. It also combines itself with other similar amino acids and uses the combined power of the two to go hunt down toxins and expel them from the body. Though the body usually produces enough, choosing to take an Aspartic Acid supplement can help increase fatigue resistance and help athletes perform longer.;BulkSupplements;L-AA-25KG;;;57.4225;

For example, D-Carnitine is the biologically inactive form of Carnitine, while L-Carnitine is the only form that is actually active. Thus, taking D-Carnitine can cause interference with the supplementation of L-Carnitine, which can then cause further problems. Carnitine is considered conditionally essential, meaning that there are certain conditions a person can undergo which might make supplementation or dietary changes necessary to keep up Carnitine levels. However, on an average day, Carnitine will not need to be supplemented. In order for the body to manufacture Carnitine at acceptable levels, it needs to be fed with good levels of Vitamin B1, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Iron, Methionine, Niacin, and Lysine. All of these must be in order for Carnitine to be created. Carnitine can then go on to make Vitamin C and E more effective. Creatine is not only able to transfer fatty acids into the cells so that they can be converted into energy\; but as it passes through cells, it is able to take toxins out with it and dispose of them, by way of the liver and kidneys. This process makes Creatine an efficient facilitator to the body’s disposal system. L-Carnitine is generally found in meats. While fruits and vegetables do have trace amounts, the greatest amount is found in meat. Usually the body can make its own Carnitine without interruption. However, some may have conditions or deficiencies which cause them to be lacking in sufficient Creatine\; and for these people, supplementation may be necessary. Acetyl-L-Carnitine is available to the public without a prescription. Not only does it provide the body with Carnitine, but also with the acetyl groups which help to eventually create Acetylcholine.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Carnitine  L-Carnitine is necessary for the oxidation of fatty acids, which can eventually help people taking Carnitine to lose fat. Fatty acids are one of the main sources of energy for the body and it would be impossible for them to penetrate the cell membrane where they are eventually turned into energy, without the presence of Carnitine.;BulkSupplements;L-CB-100;;;0.2200;

In order for the body to manufacture Carnitine at acceptable levels, it needs to be fed with good levels of Vitamin B1, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Iron, Methionine, Niacin, and Lysine. All of these must be in order for Carnitine to be created. Carnitine can then go on to make Vitamin C and E more effective. Creatine is not only able to transfer fatty acids into the cells so that they can be converted into energy\; but as it passes through cells, it is able to take toxins out with it and dispose of them, by way of the liver and kidneys. This process makes Creatine an efficient facilitator to the body’s disposal system. L-Carnitine is generally found in meats. While fruits and vegetables do have trace amounts, the greatest amount is found in meat. Usually the body can make its own Carnitine without interruption. However, some may have conditions or deficiencies which cause them to be lacking in sufficient Creatine\; and for these people, supplementation may be necessary. Acetyl-L-Carnitine is available to the public without a prescription. Not only does it provide the body with Carnitine, but also with the acetyl groups which help to eventually create Acetylcholine.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Carnitine  L-Carnitine is necessary for the oxidation of fatty acids, which can eventually help people taking Carnitine to lose fat. Fatty acids are one of the main sources of energy for the body and it would be impossible for them to penetrate the cell membrane where they are eventually turned into energy, without the presence of Carnitine.;BulkSupplements;L-CB-1KG;;;2.2050;

This metabolic process explains why Citrulline Malate can protect the body from symptoms of acidosis and from muscle fatigue after physical exertion.  Citrulline is an amino acid which has been extracted from watermelon, called 'citrullus' in Latin, thus the term Citrulline. It is produced from Arginine in the roots of human hair follicles by the action of the enzyme Trichohyalin. It is also produced from Arginine in reaction to the activity of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase.  Citrulline is a key component in the urea cycle, the process of producing Ammonia among mammals. It is produced from Carbamoyl Phosphate and Ornithine during major chemical reactions that occur in this process.  DL-Malic Acid on the other hand, is used as food additive mainly to adjust pH level while inhibiting the growth of bacteria. In the production of tea, Malic Acid is added to bottled tea beverages to achieve a pH level of 4.5   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY L-CITRULLINE DL-MALATE 1:1 L-Citrulline DL-Malate boosts energy during athletic performance, extreme physical exertion and exercise by removing Ammonia and Lactic Acid from the muscles\; two substances that tend to interfere with efficient muscle activity.

This means that the body generally produces enough of it on its own, but during exercise, much of it can be depleted which means that Cysteine will need to be supplemented in order to get the right amount back in the body. Cysteine helps to keep protein structures intact and also helps in the formation of collagen indirectly which gives it its effects of helping to maintain hair, nail, and skin health. This is not the only thing Cysteine is good for though, also going on to promote the production of Glutathione and L-Taurine. Glutathione is an antioxidant which helps keep the nervous system going and protects healthy cells from damage by free radicals. Taking Glutathione alone is not a good way to supplement Glutathione as Cysteine is required to facilitate it. Taurine also helps the nervous system stay in order while maintaining the function of the eyes, correct levels of blood pressure, the burning of fat, and the building of muscle. L-Cysteine also heightens the amount of N-Acetyl Cysteine in the body which in turn helps the body to maintain muscle mass and Glutathione levels more efficiently. The body needs L-Cysteine for the immune system to activate at the right time and also needs it to produce T-cells and insulin.  Cysteine may be derived from Methionine and can also be found by itself in high protein foods. As well as certain vegetables and spices such as onions, broccoli, garlic, and red peppers.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Cysteine HCl  Taurine cannot be created in the body without Cysteine which means it would be much harder for the body to retain lean muscle mass with it, and Cysteine is also needed for Glutathione to be created correctly.

It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc., into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose\; one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis, as well as in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels. Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs. Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation. It is sometimes considered fuel for the brain too, as it is one of the few acids with the ability to make it beyond the blood-brain barrier. It can be found in a variety of different foods including legumes, meats and fish, dairy, and various protein powders.   Health Benefits Provided By L-Glutamine  Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as Glutamic acid by the brain. This then acts as a neurotransmitter. Without Glutamine it would be impossible for the muscles to correctly synthesize proteins, thus never increasing in mass as they should.;BulkSupplements;L-GLU-100;;;0.2200;

Alpha-ketoglutarate is important in the Krebs cycle. This is the cycle the body goes through which allows various nutrients, proteins, fats, etc to be converted into H2O and carbon dioxide in order to also create usable energy for the body. Glutamine is stored in the muscles and metabolizing organs until the body is in need of energy. Then it is released and converted into glucose when the body needs it. It is also used to keep alkaline levels balanced and to synthesize both RNA and DNA when needed. Glutamine can be found naturally in a variety of meat and dairy related sources such as fish, eggs, and other meats and dairy (and even some plants that are known to have particularly high levels of protein).   Health Benefits Provided by Glutamine AKG  Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Much of the energy that glutamine is responsible for creating goes on to power the immune system which would not be nearly as effective without the influence of glutamine.

Isoleucine in the body is generally found in its highest concentrations in the muscles and it is very important for athletes in particular to have high amounts of it at all times, but particularly right before exercise. Right after exercise, levels of Isoleucine will be spent and will need to be recovered. However some choose to supplement Isoleucine one hour before exercise so that it will balance out the loss afterwards and it will not take long to regain whatever was lost and reach normal amounts again. Isoleucine is used mainly to provide muscles with energy as this is where it is usually stored. When you are deficient in Isoleucine the symptoms can range from dizziness and headache to fatigue, irritability, and confusion, and even Depression. Isoleucine is generally thought of in conjunction with other Branch Chain Amino Acids including Valine and Leucine. When taking Isoleucine supplements it is important to supplement other Branch Chain Amino Acids or this can have an adverse effect on the kidneys and liver. For this reason, Isoleucine should always be taken with two parts Leucine and one part Valine for every one part of Isoleucine. Despite the effects of Isoleucine on its own, for full muscle recovery to take place it is best that all three BCAAs be present in the system.

Isoleucine in the body is generally found in its highest concentrations in the muscles and it is very important for athletes in particular to have high amounts of it at all times, but particularly right before exercise. Right after exercise, levels of Isoleucine will be spent and will need to be recovered. However some choose to supplement Isoleucine one hour before exercise so that it will balance out the loss afterwards and it will not take long to regain whatever was lost and reach normal amounts again. Isoleucine is used mainly to provide muscles with energy as this is where it is usually stored. When you are deficient in Isoleucine the symptoms can range from dizziness and headache to fatigue, irritability, and confusion, and even Depression. Isoleucine is generally thought of in conjunction with other Branch Chain Amino Acids including Valine and Leucine. When taking Isoleucine supplements it is important to supplement other Branch Chain Amino Acids or this can have an adverse effect on the kidneys and liver. For this reason, Isoleucine should always be taken with two parts Leucine and one part Valine for every one part of Isoleucine.

This makes it very highly sought after by athletes. The best way to take BCAAs is together\; and for this particular chain, it is best to take two parts Leucine, one part Valine, and one part Isoleucine. Leucine may be found in a variety of sources including meats, cheeses, and wheat and soy flour. The ability for the body to metabolize protein is dependent upon there being a large propensity of Leucine in the body. Body building supplements are routinely stocked with Leucine as its properties allow it to effect exercise performance. It also keeps lean muscle tissue intact during exercise and keeps levels of nitrogen in the body at a balanced level. BCAAs are the most important of all amino acid types because not only do they have an immense effect on the way that muscles are built and broken down, but they also help to maintain the overall working biochemistry of the body. Therefore they combine both effects of the less important amino acids into one, two, or three very important amino acids that all work synergistically.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Leucine  Just like Valine and Isoleucine, L-Leucine is able to repair damaged muscles and keep blood sugar at appropriate levels. It also helps to burn fat and get rid of pervasive fats that are normally hard to get rid of through normal exercise and dieting. This makes Leucine a favorite amongst bodybuilders, power-lifters, and anyone else that is trying to maximize muscle size while minimizing fat. Most BCAAs are able to maximize muscle retention through conversion to glucose. This is the most effective of the other BCAAs because it is converted to glucose faster than others. Leucine levels are known to decrease with every strenuous exercise regimen. They decrease immediately afterwards and will stay low for some time. To help counteract this process it is a good idea to supplement Leucine one hour before beginning a particularly strenuous exercise routine. ;BulkSupplements;L-LEU-100;;;0.2200;

Health Benefits Provided by L-Lysine HCL  Lysine is one chemical which eventually goes on to help build protein. Not only that but it helps with the creation of various enzymes, and hormones. It also helps maintain the body’s levels of nitrogen and helps to create new antibodies to bolster the immune system. Carnitine helps in the breakdown of fatty acids and in their eventual transformation into energy for the body. Lysine is essential in the creation of Carnitine. Collagen manufactures to some extent with the help of Lysine, and Collagen is needed for the health of bones, teeth, important organs, and blood vessels.   ;BulkSupplements;L-LYS-HCL-25KG;;;57.4225;

The reason that the body needs Methionine is that it helps produce Cysteine and Taurine which help to support the cardiovascular system, build up healthy tissue, and get rid of bad bodily toxins. The body also uses these sulfur compounds to help develop the hair, nails, and skin. Sulfur also aids the kidneys in getting rid of metallic toxins present in there. Methionine is what is known as a Lipotropic, which means that it helps the liver in rapidly processing fats. Chemicals also a part of the Lipotropic group are Inositol, Betaine, and Choline which each help out the liver in one way or another. It also helps to support the production of Glutathione which helps to further detoxify the liver. Methionine is also necessary in the body’s natural production of Creatine, a chemical that is used to build muscle, support the cardiac region, and create new energy and boost overall athletic performance.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Methionine  Methionine facilitates the body’s protein synthesizing functions, particularly in the case of muscle protein. Methionine also provides the body with much needed sulfur which is necessary for the body to produce energy and helps out with antioxidants in the system to keep free radicals from damaging healthy cells. Methionine helps to break fats down and keeps the digestive system well supported while getting rid of dangerous heavy metals in the liver and regulating the levels of other compounds containing sulfur within the liver.;BulkSupplements;L-MTH-100;;;0.2200;

However, it also helps muscles grow in already fully grown adults and it also helps to get rid of excess Ammonia. This is important because it is Ammonia that usually leads to so much fatigue and soreness of the muscles. Taking Glutamine along with OKG can help even further reduce recovery time so that muscles need not be in pain days after exercise. It can help them heal and feel less sore very soon after exercise. Glutamine is also necessary in its own right for its role in the Krebs Cycle and restoring energy to the body when in need of it after and during exercise. Ornithine may be found in high levels in meat and dairy products.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate  OKG is helpful in increasing protein synthesis and in lowering the catabolism of protein. It also helps Glucose be more easily absorbed into the muscles for immediate use as well as other amino acids and it even increases the production and rate of excretion of the chemicals insulin and somatropin. Not only does OKG help to expel Ammonia once it is taken, but while it is in the system it slows the accumulation of Ammonia meaning that your body does not take in as much while it is in the body. This is due to the fact that Glutamine is retained so easily from the other properties of OKG. OKG is good for athletes that want to increase endurance and increase exercise time. On a less exercise related note, Ornithine is also helpful in maintaining healthy hair and is needed in order for Citrulline, Glutamic acids, and Proline to be produced at normal rates. These three chemicals also all help increase cellular energy production. ;BulkSupplements;L-OAKG-100;;;0.2200;

Glutamine is also necessary in its own right for its role in the Krebs Cycle and restoring energy to the body when in need of it after and during exercise. Ornithine may be found in high levels in meat and dairy products.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate  OKG is helpful in increasing protein synthesis and in lowering the catabolism of protein. It also helps Glucose be more easily absorbed into the muscles for immediate use as well as other amino acids and it even increases the production and rate of excretion of the chemicals insulin and somatropin. Not only does OKG help to expel Ammonia once it is taken, but while it is in the system it slows the accumulation of Ammonia meaning that your body does not take in as much while it is in the body. This is due to the fact that Glutamine is retained so easily from the other properties of OKG. OKG is good for athletes that want to increase endurance and increase exercise time. On a less exercise related note, Ornithine is also helpful in maintaining healthy hair and is needed in order for Citrulline, Glutamic acids, and Proline to be produced at normal rates. These three chemicals also all help increase cellular energy production. ;BulkSupplements;L-OAKG-1KG;;;2.2050;

This is especially true during exercise, meaning that if Threonine is taken prior to exercise, the other supplements taken beforehand will be absorbed more efficiently. Most meat products work as good sources of Threonine and even though it is an essential nutrient, even among vegetarians, deficiencies are relatively rare. However, vegans and vegetarians who are totally rigid in their diet may want to consider Threonine supplementation. Threonine deficiency may lead to side effects such as emotional outbursts, confusion, and problems with the digestive system and liver.  L-threonine Health Benefits  Threonine is found in many different proteins in the body as it is part of what makes many of them up. It also helps in the formation of tooth enamel and elastin as well as collagen. It does this through facilitating the production of Serine and Glycine which then go on to be used to form collagen and elastin. It is also integral in the body’s natural healing process once an injury has occurred. Threonine may also be converted into glucose in the liver. It can be used to help with digestion, cardiovascular functioning, the immune system functions (through the genesis of new antibodies), the nervous system, and the liver.;BulkSupplements;L-THR-250;;;0.5510;

On the contrary, there are many dietary sources that Tyrosine may be derived from such as almonds, pumpkin seeds, many different types of dairy, bananas, lima beans, and sesame seeds.  Health Benefits Provided By L-Tyrosine  Tyrosine is a precursor to the very important neurotransmitters, Dopamine and Norepinephrine. Tyrosine may also have an effect on the level of mental cognition that a person can reach, not to mention the fact that it can also reduce the level of physical fatigue resulting at the end of a long difficult exercise regimen. Tyrosine is needed to establish ambulatory actions. On top of that, Tyrosine also protects healthy cells from free radicals by acting as an antioxidant.;BulkSupplements;L-TYR-1KG;;;2.2050;

It is considered an essential amino acid because the body cannot provide significant enough amounts on its own. It must be found through supplementation or other dietary means. L-Valine and other BCAAs are usually processed in the liver. They go through the metabolic process in the muscles and thus, they influence the way that muscles recover after intense exercise. L-Valine is important for lowering the speed of muscle breakdown during exercise and for increasing the rate of glucose production. It also helps Tryptophan, Phenylalanine, and Tyrosine become more easily transmitted to and from the brain. Like other BCAAs when it is being processed in the liver it also possesses the ability to help the liver remove harmful toxins and it is also able to use the nitrogen created there to transport it to other areas of the body to help remove toxins there as well. Athletes who are constantly exercising and those that have restricted themselves to low protein diets should consider supplementation of Valine because their levels will generally be lower due to their lifestyle. When taking this supplement it is best to take it with two parts Leucine and one part Isoleucine to every part of Valine in order to make sure amino acid content in the body stays balanced. Many natural food sources also contain high Valine content though. These include green leafy veggies, meats, soy protein, beans, milk, peanuts, and mushrooms.  Health Benefits Provided by L-Valine  In order for muscles to metabolize correctly, Valine is needed. Valine is also important for tissue repair, though what sets it apart from other BCAAs is that it is mostly responsible for maintaining nitrogen levels and for acting as a direct energy source for muscles. After intense exercise, levels of Valine are usually lowered significantly. Therefore it is best to take Valine one hour before exercise to help balance out what is lost before it is lost.;BulkSupplements;L-VAL-100;;;0.2200;

NAC is particularly useful in the eye lenses as it stops the Peroxidation and Glycosylation of lipids. For those that are not familiar with what this means, oxidation is the name given to the metabolism of Oxygen. The metabolism of Oxygen is what eventually leads to the accidental formation of free radicals, which in turn go on to harm the body. Therefore, NAC is instrumental in the indirect prevention of free radical damage. The name Glycosylation is given to the process involving protein oxidation via sugar. While the technical details of this are fairly complicated, the end result is a reduction in cell functionality and the overall possibility of cell death. It is very important not to confuse N-Acetyl L-Carnosine with either Acetyl L-Carnosine or L-Carnitine. This is because the latter two are amino acids which are completely different from N-Acetyl L-Carnosine and do not have nearly the same effects as N-Acetyl L-Carnosine.  Health Benefits Provided by N-Acetyl L-Carnosine  N-Acetyl L-Carnosine is an amino acid that possesses the properties of a strong antioxidant which protects against free radicals. NAC can reduce the level of lactic acid that collects in muscle tissue, thereby reducing the amount of damage done to muscle tissue over time. Indirectly this can influence the ability of athletes to perform more effectively. Carnosine can be manufactured by the body to some extent through the bond that takes place during the synthesis of Alanine and Histidine.

It is a nonessential amino acid which means that the body alone can manufacture large enough amounts of it that it need not be supplemented through dietary means. Tyrosine may also be used to form neurotransmitters that feed directly into the brain which scientists have determined may have an effect on cognitive abilities. Tyrosine is also a precursor that eventually becomes, through a process of synthesis, at least one of a few different hormones which is essential to bodily and mental development.

Health Benefits Provided by Taurine  Taurine is easily dissolved in water and is able to neutralize specific molecules which eventually result in the genesis of free radicals, molecules which damage the healthy cells in the body. In this sense it has antioxidant capabilities. Taurine is in fact very useful to the immune system, so much so that when someone is suffering from a deficiency of Taurine, the immune system is greatly weakened. Taurine is found in its highest concentrations in the white blood cells. Taurine does not only aid in immune system performance though, it also helps detoxify the body, and it helps to promote the integrity of cellular structures. This amino acid keeps calcium levels in the body regulated too. Athletes like to use Taurine because it keeps stamina up by reducing the pain felt after exercise and also, functioning very similar to Creatine, allows muscles to stay directly hydrated, adding to their overall volume.;BulkSupplements;TAU-5KG;;;11.0231;

Taurine is derived from the reaction between Methionine and Cysteine when they become synthesized together. Taurine does not only add to muscle mass though, it also transports certain nutrients through the cell wall such as Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium. This keeps each individual cell healthy by electrically stabilizing the outer membrane using just the right amount of nutrients. Taurine allows for extra nerve impulses which better regulates muscle usage and keeps the level of ions located within a cell at a more acceptable level. Taurine affects the brain in such a way that it is useful to both the nervous system and the functioning of the heart too. Chenodeoxychloic Acid, one of the types of bile found in the stomach with the most abundance is made up of Taurine as a chief component. This means that in a sense, Taurine is also indirectly important in breaking down fats to be used by the body ads energy. It is necessary for this type of bile to be present in order for the body to absorb vitamins which have been dissolved into fatty solutions. Thus, Taurine is a necessary amino acid in that it allows for the digestion of fat soluble vitamins.

When it is ingested, it instantly goes to work circulating through all of the watery areas of the human body (once it has been absorbed into the intestines, of course) and from there, helps in the fortification of Collagen while acting as an antioxidant during the trip. Vitamin C is routinely used as a food additive along with other kinds of antioxidants like Calcium salts, Sodium, and Potassium. It is for this reason that the traditional Vitamin C supplements that can be bought in stores contain not only Ascorbic Acid, but many other types of Ascorbates that fit a similar purpose. Vitamin C also has a host of other general uses. It assists in the repair of damaged tissue, in keeping up healthy levels of Collagen\; and in conjunction with equally essential insoluble compounds, such as Vitamin E. Vitamin C helps these become generally more effective at what they already accomplish for the body.  IS THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE VITAMIN C THE BIOACTIVE FORM L-ASCORBIC ACID?  There has been some concern due to shady business tactics from a variety of companies that the generally available forms of Vitamin C may not be as active as would generally be desired. Well, you should feel relieved to know that this is no longer a practice that is followed by any company. Worldwide, the stock of Vitamin C on all store shelves is the bioactive form L-Ascorbic Acid.  HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY ASCORBIC ACID POWDER  Vitamin C is most well known for its usefulness in conjunction with other enzymes and solutions. This widens the usefulness of Vitamin C considerably more from its already essential position. It is a necessary ingredient in the building of tissue, in the protection and fortification of the immune system, in Collagen strengthening, in the synthesizing of Carnitine (which is the first step in the process of cellular metabolism), and in helping to maintain bone and teeth structure. It also helps convert Tetrahydrofolic acid from Folacin. Of course it should go without saying at this point that Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant. Much like Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), Vitamin C is also useful in the neutralization of harmful free radical molecules, and it also helps to police any threatening activity that may be occurring in any of the watery parts of the body. Not only does Vitamin C help in the fortification of Collagen, it is actually an essential building block of this type of protein tissue. Collagen can be found throughout all parts of the body and it is what controls our body’s level of flexibility to an extent, while also strengthening blood vessels, teeth, gums, cartilage, vertebrae, etc. Vitamin C is even essential in healing minor wounds and cuts through its Collagen production.

It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose, one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis and in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels. Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs. Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation. It is sometimes considered fuel for the brain too, as it is one of the few acids with the ability to make it beyond the blood-brain barrier. It can be found in a variety of different foods including legumes, meats and fish, dairy, and various protein powders. Health Benefits Provided By N-Acetyl L-Glutamine  Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as Glutamic Acid by the brain. This then acts as a neurotransmitter. Without Glutamine it would be impossible for the muscles to correctly synthesize proteins, thus never increasing in mass as they should. ;BulkSupplements;N-ACE-L-GLU-100;;;0.2200;

Health Benefits Provided By N-Acetyl L-Glutamine  Glutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as Glutamic Acid by the brain. This then acts as a neurotransmitter. Without Glutamine it would be impossible for the muscles to correctly synthesize proteins, thus never increasing in mass as they should. ;BulkSupplements;N-ACE-L-GLU-250;;;0.5510;

It is the main source of fuel used by cells to complete the process of transferring fats, sugars, etc into usable energy that the body can store for later. This is because Glutamine can be stored in the body and later converted into glucose, one of the chief energy providers for the body, whenever the body is in need of more energy. This is what makes this supplement such an attractive option for high endurance athletes with strict training regimens. It is taken not only to considerably raise energy levels, but also to help the body more effectively burn fat, while adding on to overall muscle mass. On a note of more general interest, Glutamine is important in DNA and RNA synthesis and in the maintenance of bodily alkaline levels. Because Glutamine is an energy source, it can be significantly reduced once exercise has taken place. Levels will stay at a low until the person has completely recovered from the exercise. Taking a Glutamine supplement may make for a reduction in recovery time, as it may help replace the lost amount as it is being used. This may be particularly effective if the supplement is taken right before the exercise occurs. Glutamine is considered a nonessential acid, which means that the body can naturally manufacture it without supplementation.

The popular reason for eating carrots for good eyesight, as cited by numerous mothers and grandmothers is not incorrect either\; as Vitamin A, also known as Retinol, is known for promoting good eyesight as well as general good health. Unfortunately, it can be toxic if it is taken in doses that are too large. Luckily, Beta-Carotene is not converted into Vitamin A by the body at a fast enough rate to reach highly toxic levels. It is for this reason that Beta-Carotene is generally preferred as a method of Vitamin A supplementation. The highest concentrations of Beta-Carotene may be found in carrots of course, as well as fruits such as cantaloupe, tomatoes, etc. It is also present in dark greens such as broccoli and squash. Sweet potatoes are a rich source of it as well. The darker the pigmentation of a plant, especially an orange one, the more Beta-Carotene it is likely to contain since pigmentation in plants is so dependent on Carotenoids such as Beta-Carotene. Beta-Carotene only has about one twelfth the potency of pure Vitamin A.  Health Benefits Provided By Beta-Carotene 1%  Because Beta-Carotene is the precursor for Vitamin A, it helps in all of the processes that Vitamin A helps in. It can be used to effectively treat deficiency of Vitamin A. Beta-Carotene assists in protection of the eyes by manufacturing Retinol, which is an ingredient necessary for good eye health. On a more indirect note, diets that are low in fat but high in fruit and vegetable content, can reduce the risk of developing some kinds of cancer. In other words, diets rich in Vitamin A while low in fats will lower your chances of getting certain types of cancer.;BulkSupplements;BC-25KG;;;55.1160;

This works because the Calcium Ascorbate solution is separated in the stomach\; the acid is separated from the calcium, yielding ascorbic acid and pure calcium respectively. In addition, the Ascorbic Acid actually facilitates the process of Calcium being absorbed into cells making the Calcium that much more efficiently received. On top of that, Ascorbic Acid also assists in more efficient absorption of iron, and in providing the body with essential antioxidants to boost the performance of the immune system. This is done by neutralizing free radicals (molecules that damage healthy cells and come about as a byproduct of metabolizing food into energy) and stopping harmful reactions that take place in water dense parts of the body. Vitamin C assists in producing Collagen, which is a protein that is necessary for providing flexibility to all sorts of bodily structures like muscles, sinews and blood vessels. On top of that, it also keeps bone marrow, bones, cartilage, discs of the vertebrae, teeth, and skin all at healthy levels. In accelerating the production of Collagen, this means that Vitamin C is an essential part of the body’s healing process. Without Vitamin C it would be significantly more difficult for clots to form and thus, stifle blood from flowing excessively out of cuts and abrasions. Aside from neutralizing free radicals, there are other ways that Vitamin C is important for sustaining the success of the immune system. It helps in the production of interferon, helps leukocytes work more efficiently, and helps to maintain the integrity of the body’s various mucous membranes to ward off infection. There are four enzymes that are necessary for humans to successfully produce Ascorbic Acid on their own, and unfortunately humans only possess three of the four. Therefore, it is necessary to always consume foods rich in Vitamin C in order to satisfy the body’s needs, since it is an essential acid.;BulkSupplements;CA-100;;;0.2200;

This works because the Calcium Ascorbate solution is separated in the stomach\; the acid is separated from the calcium, yielding ascorbic acid and pure calcium respectively. In addition, the Ascorbic Acid actually facilitates the process of Calcium being absorbed into cells making the Calcium that much more efficiently received. On top of that, Ascorbic Acid also assists in more efficient absorption of iron, and in providing the body with essential antioxidants to boost the performance of the immune system. This is done by neutralizing free radicals (molecules that damage healthy cells and come about as a byproduct of metabolizing food into energy) and stopping harmful reactions that take place in water dense parts of the body. Vitamin C assists in producing Collagen, which is a protein that is necessary for providing flexibility to all sorts of bodily structures like muscles, sinews and blood vessels. On top of that, it also keeps bone marrow, bones, cartilage, discs of the vertebrae, teeth, and skin all at healthy levels. In accelerating the production of Collagen, this means that Vitamin C is an essential part of the body’s healing process. Without Vitamin C it would be significantly more difficult for clots to form and thus, stifle blood from flowing excessively out of cuts and abrasions. Aside from neutralizing free radicals, there are other ways that Vitamin C is important for sustaining the success of the immune system.

;Choline DL-Bitartrate - 25kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/choline-bitartrate.html;CB-25KG;298.45;;men, women;849720001849;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_274.jpg;Choline is actually a fairly basic lecithin found in many different food products, especially organs, beans, wheat germ, eggs, peanuts, and other dairy. Meats are the best sources of it because the highest concentrations of Choline are typically found in the fat portions of the cell membranes, meaning foods with higher fat content are more likely to have higher amounts of Choline. Choline is thought to be useful in muscle contraction, and general good coordination skills. Choline is useful in a variety of other ways too, such as cell communications, stabilizing the correct functions of muscles, regulation of impulse transmission through the nervous system, and in the production of Acetylcholine, which is known to influence state of mind, eating habits, and general behavior. Finally, Choline can also act as an antioxidant to some extent, protecting healthy cells from harmful free radicals.  Health Benefits Provided By Choline Bitartrate  Choline is a nutrient necessary for the body in order to keep up the emulsification of fats and cholesterol, and to facilitate the movement of hormones to the correct areas of the body. It is necessary for proper functioning of the nervous system, the liver, and the gallbladder. Even though it is not actually a B vitamin, it is sometimes considered to be a part of this complex because it operates in conjunction with various types of B vitamins to maintain adequate levels of health in the body. Choline Bitartrate is indirectly involved in the conversion of fat into energy and nutrients, speeds up their mobilization throughout the body, and also aids in the production of HDL, a helpful type of cholesterol. Choline also assists in the formation of Betaine, which is a methyl donor of no small importance. Choline is especially important in establishing endurance when it comes to physical exercise. Choline becomes depleted very quickly in athletes that participate in taxing exercise regimens. This in turn means that less Acetylcholine can be synthesized, which could result in permanent damage to the liver or to muscles. This makes Choline supplementation both viable and recommended for athletes.;BulkSupplements;CB-25KG;;;57.4225;

It does this by jump starting many different biological processes including increased rate of protein production as well as muscle contraction. It is this Adenosine Triphosphate, coming from Coenzyme Q10, which is directly responsible for acting as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzyme complexes, thus creating energy for the cell. Oddly enough, reindeer is one of the largest sources of Coenzyme Q10 with other meat products such as oily fish and pork coming up behind it. As few as one hundred different foods can provide Coenzyme Q10, however the ones that are found in most common diets contain far less than what would constitute a proper single serving of Coenzyme Q10.   Health Benefits Provided By Coenzyme Q10  In addition to acting indirectly as an energy source for every cell in the body, it also can provide services as an antioxidant in neutralizing harmful free radicals. Past age thirty though, the amount of Coenzyme Q10 in the body begins a sharp decline which causes the body to be more susceptible to damage from these harmful molecules. Coenzyme Q10 works an immune system strengthener, and as a coenzyme for various other types of enzymes which provide many different services for the body at a cellular level. Unlike other supplements, Coenzyme Q10 can actually be taken both as a dietary supplement and also as a topical rub in order for the intended effects to be experienced. Without Coenzyme Q10, the mitochondria in each cell would find it very difficult to correctly or efficiently process cholesterol and fat. It also provides the helpful service of increasing levels of blood and oxygen to be used by the heart. When Coenzyme Q10 is taken as a supplement, it is best to also supplement Vitamin E, C, or both at the same time along with it as these will both have the effect of optimizing the supplement’s overall performance.;BulkSupplements;COQ10-C-25KG;;;58.4225;

The health benefits of Grape Seed Extract were first discovered in the 20th century when French diets were being studied. Even though their diets were extremely high in fat\; which should have put them all at risk for heart disease, they somehow remained resistant to it.

In other words, Grape Seed Extract helps keep the cardiovascular system very healthy. What Does Grape Seed Extract Powder Actually Contain?  There are very many ingredients in Grape Seed powder which are meant to promote general health such as Polyphenols, and protein which have been mentioned above, as well as others like lipids, carbohydrates, and flavonoids. One particular component of Grape Seed Extract which is unique is Procyanidin (which was nicknamed Vitamin P by its founder, a name that did not end up taking off). Despite the fact that the name Vitamin P never took, it is quite an important nutrient helping to maintain comprehensive oral health as well as health of bones, hair, skin, and other body tissues. The skin is protected well in particular as Procyanidin protects it from damaging rays. Grape Seed Extract also has Resveratrol\; an antioxidant that is particularly useful in helping with cardiovascular health, and is likely responsible for the low rates of heart disease amongst the French.

They all come from the same plant, but have different ways of being processed, thus impacting the reasons they are taken and how they are used. Since green tea is not a fermented product, it has high polyphenol content. Polyphenols are normally lost during fermentation\; and although the other tea types do contain some, they have much less than green tea does. These polyphenols have antioxidant properties which are what protect the body from free radicals. Though Vitamin E and C are often touted as being powerful antioxidants, time and time again various studies have shown that polyphenols actually contain more antioxidants than Vitamin E or C. On top of that, polyphenols are also responsible for increasing the effectiveness of the body’s own antioxidant enzymes, thereby adding an even greater level of protection. Glutathione is one of these enzymes, which makes green tea extract with polyphenols even more useful as this enzyme reduces inflammation and protects the cartilage. Green Tea also contains EGCG (gallocatechol, sometimes referred to as epigallocatechin) which is a type of compound that can be found in such diverse areas as green tea, bananas, and pomegranates. This compound goes on to provide aid to areas of the body such as the immune system, and the central nervous system, giving this supplement a wide variety of uses. In addition, and due to the reactions that EGCG causes in the nervous system, this allows the cells in the brain to be ultra-receptive to impulses, meaning that EGCG may have the ability to increase mental capacity and cognition speed. Aside from the way in which green tea influences the immune system, it has been the subject of numerous studies into its functions as an anticarcinogen. No conclusive evidence has been published yet, but prospects are positive. Caffeine is a useful psychoactive substance in that it is able to prevent drowsiness to some extent. It should never be used as a substitute for real sleep, but in situations in which sleep is not possible, caffeine can play a large role in keeping a person awake long enough until sleep is possible once more.;BulkSupplements;GTPE-25KG;;;57.4225;

They all come from the same plant, but have different ways of being processed, thus impacting the reasons they are taken and how they are used. Since Green Tea is not a fermented product, it has high Polyphenol content. Polyphenols are normally lost during fermentation, and though the other tea types do contain some, they have much less than green tea does. These Polyphenols have antioxidant properties which are what protect the body from free radicals. Though Vitamin E and C are often touted as being powerful antioxidants, time and time again various studies have shown that Polyphenols actually contain more antioxidants than Vitamin E or C. On top of that, Polyphenols are also responsible for increasing the effectiveness of the body’s own antioxidant enzymes, thereby adding an even greater level of protection. Glutathione is one of these enzymes, which makes Green Tea Extract with Polyphenols even more useful as this enzyme reduces inflammation and protects the cartilage. Green Tea also contains EGCG (Gallocatechol, sometimes referred to as Epigallocatechin) which is a type of compound that can be found in such diverse areas as green tea, bananas, and pomegranates. This compound goes on to provide aid to areas of the body, such as the immune system and the central nervous system, giving this supplement a wide variety of uses. In addition to, and due to the reactions that EGCG causes in the nervous system\; the cells in the brain are allowed to be ultra-receptive to impulses, meaning that EGCG may have the ability to increase mental capacity and cognition speed.

Also, Carotenoid containing vegetables are more easily absorbed, and their Carotenoid content more easily absorbed when the vegetables are steamed. Most of the time it is hard to get the correct amount of Lutein needed by the body by way of one’s diet. For this reason it is best to supplement a Carotenoid such as this.

It can also be manufactured by the body to a small degree. Taken as a supplement, DMG is able to facilitate the creation of many different chemicals through enzymatic reactions, including but not limited to Choline, Methionine, and other important neurotransmitters. The substance known as Betaine that DMG is so often compared to is essentially actually just a Glycine which has been attached to three different methyl groups. This separates it from Dimethyl Glycine by only one methyl group. Since DMG is so closely related to Glycine, it is also an important component in the production of energy for the body. It can assist in the exercise process by easing the pain felt by straining muscles and in reducing fatigue felt after particularly draining exercise. Glycine is considered nonessential, but is very important in the formation of various muscle tissues and it also helps with the maintenance of the digestive and nervous systems, keeping them in working order. By increasing the amount of Creatine as well as the amount of Glucose in the body, Glycine is able to create even more energy and assist in the growth of muscles, while also regulating levels of blood sugar. Glycine can be found at very high concentrations throughout the body, but particularly in the muscles, collagen and skin. Glycine is actually necessary in order for a good healthy digestive system to be kept intact by producing more bile that breaks down fats and separates nutrients out of food that can be used by the cells later. For this reason Glycine is the chief ingredient in most commercially bought antacids.  Health Benefits Provided by N,N-Dimethyl Glycine Anhydrous  DMG can increase the effectiveness of the immune system while also helping cells to make better use of oxygen. It also functions as an antioxidant preventing healthy cells from being damaged by free radicals, in an indirect fashion. Lactic Acid is an acid that is credited with, when built up in large amounts over time, damaging muscle tissue. DMG is useful because it has the ability to neutralize this harmful acid, so not only does it promote muscle growth, but it actually discourages muscle degradation.;BulkSupplements;NNDGA-25KG;;;55.1160;

Due to the fact that the human body cannot manufacture Folate through use of PABA (something which all other elements classified as vitamins can do) it was found that this should not actually be considered a vitamin. This does not make it any less important though, as it was also determined that PABA remains essential in the metabolic process. Para-Aminobenzoic Acid is even referred to as Vitamin Bx informally despite the fact that it is not classified as either a vitamin or a nutrient with essential properties. It is called this because it is included in the family of the Vitamin B complex, but is not, itself, part of the normal Vitamin B chain. It is merely a constituent of Folacin.  Health Benefits Provided by Para-Aminobenzoic Acid  PABA has antioxidant properties meaning that it protects against damage done by free radical molecules which can be quite harmful to healthy cells. These come into being during periods when the body is undergoing oxidative stress, and PABA can help neutralize them before they grow to be out of control. This is not the only way PABA helps the body. It also keeps up oxygen levels in the blood, and helps to produce both electrolytes and red blood cells. Since PABA has the ability to increase rates of protein synthesis this makes it an ideal supplement for people seeking to build up muscle mass.;BulkSupplements;PABA-25KG;;;57.4225;

;R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (R-ALA) - 25kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/alpha-lipoic-acid-r-ala.html;R-ALA-25KG;10286.10;;men, women;849720000231;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_271.jpg;In order to get things straight, it is important to note that the taxonomic chasm separating R-ALA from RS-ALA is a wide one. R-ALA is a more expensive alternative because it can be absorbed by the body much more easily than RS-ALA, and is also much more difficult to manufacture. Most ALA that is manufactured comes in the form of RS-ALA, with R-ALA taking up a much smaller percentage of production rates. R-ALA can be found in various levels of availability in all organs and muscles within the human body and is fat soluble. After ALA is taken in the form of a supplement or enough is ingested via food, it enters the blood stream effortlessly, and is able to circulate through the brain as well. It is useful, when taken in conjunction with vitamin supplements such as Vitamin C and E, in the protection of cells and in expelling waste or other harmful materials out of the body. Taking this into account, ALA also assists in recycling various other antioxidants such as Glutathione, the aforementioned Vitamins C, and E, and it even renews itself to an extent which has lead to its colorful nickname, “The universal antioxidant.” ALA helps speed up the process of creating energy from various proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Glutathione, another important antioxidant that helps in the protection of the cellular structure, in preserving the effectiveness of the immune system, and in the detoxification of the liver, is increased in production levels by ALA. This is the only antioxidant that is known to have this effect on Glutathione levels. It is broken down before it has reached the cells, in the digestive tract, making ALA’s ability to boost the levels of Glutathione quite important.   Health Benefits Provided by Alpha Lipoic Acid  The Krebs cycle is the body’s process for turning sugars and carbohydrates into usable energy, and ALA is also instrumental in facilitating this process. Free radicals, molecules that have gone out of control and can cause damage to other cells while they circulate throughout the body, are neutralized by the healing power of ALA. ALA is also known for helping in the regulation of levels of cholesterol, which in turn contributes to an overall feeling of well-being. ALA is also especially helpful for athletes because it’s free-radical-neutralizing properties helps in speeding up muscle recovery, which means longer exercising sessions and less pain felt during exercise. It is also useful in speeding up metabolism, and in delivering necessary nutrients as well as carbohydrates.   Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl-L-Carnitine  Acetyl-L-Carnitine, or ALCAR is another form of antioxidant which is naturally produced by the body. In conjunction with ALA, it is known to help to speed up brain functions and heighten mental acuity. For this reason they are usually found to be blended together in products. ALCAR and ALA together can help speed up the transfer of glucose to muscle greatly, and this blend can also help to increase the utilization of fatty acids and energy production at a cellular level. These compounds come combined together in capsules at a level of 175mg of ALA and 425mg ALCAR respectively. Because the taste of ALA can be abrasive to the tongue, these products are generally found together in capsule form alone.      ;BulkSupplements;R-ALA-25KG;;;57.4225;

Since of the 8 forms of Vitamin E half are Tocopherols and the other half are Tocotrienols, this product contains large quantities of alpha, delta, and gamma Tocopherols and a few beta. Alpha-Tocopherol is the most effective of these forms in terms of its tendency and ability to be absorbed by the body. It is located throughout the human blood stream and is known for being both the most active type of Vitamin E in the body and also the only naturally occurring kind of Alpha-Tocopherol. There is some research which remarks on the possibility for the effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol to be increased when in the presence of other Tocopherols\; however this research has yet to be proven for certain. As far as the comparison between natural and synthetic forms of Tocopherols, the competition isn't even close. Natural Tocopherol beats out synthetic Vitamin E in terms of retention as well as absorption every time. Vitamin E can be found in many different skin creams because it is known for promoting skin health and elasticity. It can even increase the healing rate when a burn or cut has been sustained if it is applied in a timely manner. Vitamin E does not only protect the skin on the outside though, it also protects it at a deeper cellular level by keeping cell membranes well protected and giving them a defense against oxidation. Vitamin E is absorbed into the blood via the lymph, which in turn takes it from the stomach just as is the case with bile and fats. Once it is in the blood, it can be transferred to the liver to be stored for later use. There the Tocopherols can use the liver as a base to send out agents to prevent free radicals from harming the body. As it is found in various supplements, Vitamin E is actually just Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate which above all, allows it to continue its antioxidant functions despite how it is absorbed and digested. Vitamin E is a relatively common dietary supplement and is sold as such. It can even be derived naturally from a few different foods. Sometimes it is even present in foods as an additive. It is often prized particularly for its effectiveness as an antioxidant. Free radicals are merely molecules with unshared electrons. These electrons are known for retaining a high level of energy and react very quickly with Reactive Oxygen Species, which are sometimes referred to as ROS for short. These ROS are formed during the simple metabolic process of transforming food into energy, and it is the job of the antioxidant to protect cells from the harmful effects of ROS. These molecules are also produced in the body as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke air pollution, and high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This type of antioxidant works by stopping the production of ROS that occur when fats are being oxidized. There are a few different chronic diseases that are associated with free radicals and at this moment, scientists are studying whether the ability of Vitamin E to hinder these processes may actually have the capacity to prevent these diseases from occurring in the first place. It is no surprise that Vitamin E also has a connection to immune system fortification given its importance as an antioxidant. However, it also has a link to various other types of metabolic processes including gene expression and cell signaling.  Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin E Powder 700 IU  The most important role that Vitamin E has in the body is to keep up the integrity of cellular structure and prevent damage to the skin while also promoting healing of the skin after it has already been damaged. Vitamin E is also revered for its ability to prevent or at least slow down the oxidation process of fats and other types of nutrients. Vitamin E is not only able to protect the skin but also provides a protective membrane around the eyes, liver, testes, and breast\; the parts of the body that are most prone to oxidation. One thing that seems to be true for most antioxidants is that they tend to work well with other antioxidants. This means that when taken in conjunction with Vitamin C, Beta-Carotene, etc., the effects of each antioxidant will actually be magnified. Vitamin E may have a strong effect on the elasticity of the skin, but it also has this same effect on arterial elasticity. This means that blood can flow, free of obstruction, and keep the arteries from being clogged. One particularly threatening aspect of oxidation is its potential to deconstruct and damage DNA, but this troubling aspect can be prevented when Vitamin E is present.;BulkSupplements;VEP-100;;;0.2200;

There are a few different chronic diseases that are associated with free radicals and at this moment, scientists are studying whether the ability of Vitamin E to hinder these processes may actually have the capacity to prevent these diseases from occurring in the first place.

Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin E Powder 700 IU  The most important role that Vitamin E has in the body is to keep up the integrity of cellular structure and prevent damage to the skin while also promoting healing of the skin after it has already been damaged. Vitamin E is also revered for its ability to prevent or at least slow down the oxidation process of fats and other types of nutrients. Vitamin E is not only able to protect the skin but also provides a protective membrane around the eyes, liver, testes, and breast\; the parts of the body that are most prone to oxidation. One thing that seems to be true for most antioxidants is that they tend to work well with other antioxidants. This means that when taken in conjunction with Vitamin C, Beta-Carotene, etc., the effects of each antioxidant will actually be magnified. Vitamin E may have a strong effect on the elasticity of the skin, but it also has this same effect on arterial elasticity. This means that blood can flow, free of obstruction, and keep the arteries from being clogged. One particularly threatening aspect of oxidation is its potential to deconstruct and damage DNA, but this troubling aspect can be prevented when Vitamin E is present.;BulkSupplements;VEP-1KG;;;2.2050;

Since of the 8 forms of Vitamin E half are Tocopherols and the other half are Tocotrienols, this product contains large quantities of alpha, delta, and gamma Tocopherols and a few beta. Alpha-Tocopherol is the most effective of these forms in terms of its tendency and ability to be absorbed by the body. It is located throughout the human blood stream and is known for being both the most active type of Vitamin E in the body and also the only naturally occurring kind of Alpha-Tocopherol. There is some research which remarks on the possibility for the effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol to be increased when in the presence of other Tocopherols\; however this research has yet to be proven for certain. As far as the comparison between natural and synthetic forms of Tocopherols, the competition isn't even close. Natural Tocopherol beats out synthetic Vitamin E in terms of retention as well as absorption every time. Vitamin E can be found in many different skin creams because it is known for promoting skin health and elasticity. It can even increase the healing rate when a burn or cut has been sustained if it is applied in a timely manner. Vitamin E does not only protect the skin on the outside though, it also protects it at a deeper cellular level by keeping cell membranes well protected and giving them a defense against oxidation. Vitamin E is absorbed into the blood via the lymph, which in turn takes it from the stomach just as is the case with bile and fats. Once it is in the blood, it can be transferred to the liver to be stored for later use. There the Tocopherols can use the liver as a base to send out agents to prevent free radicals from harming the body. As it is found in various supplements, Vitamin E is actually just Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate which above all, allows it to continue its antioxidant functions despite how it is absorbed and digested. Vitamin E is a relatively common dietary supplement and is sold as such. It can even be derived naturally from a few different foods. Sometimes it is even present in foods as an additive. It is often prized particularly for its effectiveness as an antioxidant. Free radicals are merely molecules with unshared electrons. These electrons are known for retaining a high level of energy and react very quickly with Reactive Oxygen Species, which are sometimes referred to as ROS for short. These ROS are formed during the simple metabolic process of transforming food into energy, and it is the job of the antioxidant to protect cells from the harmful effects of ROS.

Those that have below average levels of Zinc will have negative symptoms such as poor night vision, slower healing after sustaining wounds, a reduction in the senses of both smell and taste, and a lack of development in the reproductive organs (if the person is younger or still developing). Reduction of Zinc levels in children can stunt growth, cause greater receptiveness to infection and disease, and inhibit sexual growth.

It is also used in some products to promote the fast healing of wounds. Zinc itself is an antioxidant and can protect healthy cells in the body from sustaining damage due to free radicals. Zinc is also an important component in many different enzymatic reactions which contribute to the regularity of the body’s development. Operations such as protein synthesis, metabolism of energy, and hormone levels (which in themselves can contribute to a great deal of important bodily growth) are all facilitated by zinc. Specifically, Collagen, and Vitamin A are both dependent upon zinc for their metabolism. Zinc also affects the ability to taste and smell, the appetite, and the levels of Vitamin E found in the blood. Zinc is commonly used to protect the skin, and as an antiseptic.  ;BulkSupplements;ZO-1KG;;;2.2050;

It is able to keep the immune system healthy, along with the digestive and reproductive systems. It also carries out many other important tasks such as cell reproduction, balancing of hormones, and absorbing vitamins and minerals correctly, not to mention the synthesis of proteins, making this a very important mineral. Zinc supplements are traditionally used as a treatment for Zinc deficiency and also to keep subjects on a path towards normal growth if there are any hormone imbalances preventing someone from developing properly. Those that have below average levels of Zinc will have negative symptoms such as poor night vision, slower healing after sustaining wounds, a reduction in the senses of both smell and taste, and a lack of development in the reproductive organs (if the person is younger or still developing). Reduction of Zinc levels in children can stunt growth, cause greater receptiveness to infection and disease, and inhibit sexual growth. There are around 800,000 deaths per year reported where Zinc deficiency was either a direct or indirect cause. In fact, Zinc deficiency is credited with being the fifth highest risk factor id disease development. This is how important Zinc is to the immune system.

In fact, Betaine HCL applies an additional amount of HCL which can be further utilized during the digestive process to help break down proteins. This makes Betaine HCL an ideal supplement for anyone with frequent indigestion issues.  Health Benefits Provided By Betaine HCL  Anyone that possesses a low amount of stomach acid can have frequent problems with indigestion which can cause stomach upset, and in worse cases, a failure for the body to absorb nutrients correctly which could easily result in fatigue and possible general sickness until the issue is resolved. If it is suspected that this might be your problem then Betaine HCL is an ideal supplement to handle the job\; as the introduction of more HCL into the system should be enough to keep the digestive tract in working order once more. The presence of Homocysteine in the system, an acid which scientists believe may be linked to cases of poor cardiovascular health or other kinds of heart issues can be reduced by maintaining good levels of Betaine. In addition to this, the presence of Betaine helps promote the production of more Carnitine, which itself, is an acid that contributes to overall physical health by making the burning of fat much more energy efficient.;BulkSupplements;BETA-HCL-25KG;;;57.4225;

Special equipment is required to harvest these algae due to their small size. This plant reproduces once every twenty hours allowing it to spread rapidly. This algae is believed to be about 2 billion years old, and was one of the first plants to have anything that could be called a defined nucleus in its cellular structure. Despite how prevalent it is, it was not actually discovered until the 19th century. It was late in the 1800’s when it was discovered by the Dutch. After its discovery, it was researched for possible use as a source of protein. Though it was regarded as a possible food source and had sufficient nutritional properties, cultivating it in order to feed the masses after the food shortage and population boom, which took place shortly after the end of WWII, was determined to be uneconomic overall. Though these pursuits were abandoned, it was still cultivated for other specific uses, and more research resulted in more uses being discovered for this algae. Chlorella are small enough to be considered microorganisms, and each individual microorganism contains the basic structure of a cell, including a nucleus, mitochondria, cell walls made up of cellulose for protection and to hold these components together along with starch grains and chloroplasts which are present in the cellular structure of most plants.  Why is Chlorella Algae Powder Popular Today?  Popularity of Chlorella Algae still endures despite how old and difficult to cultivate it is. Why is this? This has to do with the adaptive history of Chlorella Algae. Because it is a freshwater plant, it had to adapt to survive periodic droughts that were very much a reality in the erratic weather patterns of the past 2 billion years. Therefore, it developed a fibrous shell around it which had two different important characteristics. It first allowed the cellular structure of the algae to be maintained as long as possible until the algae had been dried out beyond all hope. Secondly, and most importantly, this shell was used to absorb nutrients in the surrounding water to keep feeding the cell for as long as possible. This happened until the water was totally gone so that when the water returns, it is able to easily bounce back to full recovery. It is this property that makes Chlorella Algae so useful to humans. This particular powder is called 'Chlorella Algae Broken Cell' because the outer shell has been cracked. This allows the nutrients within the algae to be more effectively absorbed while still providing the same benefits of the outer shell to the human body and digestive tract.  Health Benefits Provided By Chlorella Blue-Green Algae  One of the most prominent health benefits of Chlorella Algae lies in its ability to detoxify the digestive tract. The outer shell of the Chlorella absorbs all of the toxic agents that are present in the digestive tract and detoxifies the intestines as it passes through. Not only that, but the insides of the algae are chock full of nutrients including Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Folic acid, Vitamin B2, Manganese, and Iodine. Chlorella Algae helps to open up the arteries, increasing blood flow, and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen that makes it to muscle tissue and all of the important areas. It also synthesizes red blood cells to stimulate creation of new blood and the production of microscopic plant cultures within the intestine. These will continue to produce similar effects to Chlorella Algae without having to take the supplement all the time. The question about the difference between Chlorella Algae and Spirulina Algae is often brought up since the two are very similar. The biggest difference is that Chlorella Algae have higher Iron content than Spirulina which can be a benefit or a drawback depending on the individual needs of the person taking it. Pregnant women often need to have higher Iron intake to make up for the amount being taken by their child. Older men also need more Iron in their diet to strengthen their bones. However, taking too much Iron can cause oxidation which puts greater pressure on the immune system to neutralize free radicals.

It passes throughout the various areas of the body via a special protein known as Ceruloplasmin. Copper must be supplemented and must have adequate levels maintained as it is essential in numerous bodily functions which are all necessary in sustaining life and health. Copper deficiency can lead to a whole host of issues. There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as a mode of delivery for Copper, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Aspartate, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few. Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels, as Copper and Zinc can compete for bodily absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two. The Gluconic Acid present in this mixture is not corrosive. It has mild effects and is organically derived from sources like fruit, kombucha, wine, and honey. The taste of it can be a bit sour, but this allows it to act as a great complement to wine, or various fruit juices. It is used in foods to help reduce levels of overall acidity and is used in some low grade cleaning products in order to help dissolve mineral buildup.  Health Benefits Provided by Copper Gluconate  As Copper is the third most abundant mineral found in the human body, it must be present in large quantities in order to maintain generally high levels of health and adequate performance of normal bodily functions including bone growth, and protection of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. To fully make use of the benefits of Iron, Copper is needed, and it is also a necessary component in near 50 other enzymes which must have Copper in order to work. Copper is a nutrient which is needed in the synthesis of Collagen, and Hemoglobin. Copper works in conjunction with Zinc and Vitamin C in order to form proteins which both build up and protect various types of tissue and also add to their flexibility and elasticity, not to mention that it is generally useful in the maintenance of healthy skin and bones, joints, and blood vessels. Copper is an antioxidant which helps to neutralize free radicals that go around threatening to cause damage to healthy cells, and copper is essential in the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a form of energy that the body uses for power.  Melanin, a skin pigment that determines the color that the hair, eyes, and skin take on, is also dependent upon large levels of Copper. When the hair begins to gray and the skin begins to grow paler due to the Copper deficiency that occurs during old age, the process may be counteracted somewhat by supplementing this mineral. Copper is a restorative agent that is crucial in helping skin maintain its elasticity and is one of the many active ingredients in most topical creams that can be bought commercially. It is one of the many factors that have an effect on the youthful appearance of the skin. While a person may not be considered deficient if they take less than the normal amount of Copper every day, there are many people that are not making use of the overwhelming list of benefits offered by Copper simply because they do not take enough. This is where supplementation may be useful, particularly for those that consume very much alcohol.;BulkSupplements;CGA-5KG;;;11.0200;

It is inextricably important to many enzymes that assist in the many different metabolic processes of the body. This mineral is commonly taken from a diverse array of sources such as organ meats, various types of seafood, legumes, and nuts. Copper must be supplemented and must have adequate levels maintained as it is essential in many bodily functions to sustain life and health. Copper deficiency can lead to a whole host of issues. There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as an alternative mode of delivery to Copper L-Aspartate, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few.

This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.  This is one of the reasons that Aspartic Acid is included in this solution because it helps to increase the rate of absorption by the body and makes the system’s usage of copper much more efficient. The Citric Acid cycle which is the key to producing energy within each individual cell is also fueled by Aspartic Acid to some degree. Aspartic Acid is a requirement in every cell in the body for this very reason. It does this by promoting the efficient transfer of electrolytes and minerals between the digestive tract and each cell individually. It can also reduce the oxygen consumption of cells during the metabolic process which allows less energy to be expended in the creation of new energy. Copper Aspartate is a nutritional analog, which means that though it is the product of synthesis, it has been tested to perform its duties as a nutritional supplement at an even higher level of effectiveness than the two or more original elements it was synthesized from. It has better absorption rates, tolerance, bioavailability, and retention than any of the parts it is made up of on their own.  How to Spot Copper Deficiency  There are a few different symptoms characteristic of Copper deficiency including increased levels of blood cholesterol, anemia, high blood pressure, stunted growth, tiredness, discolored or brittle hair, etc. This type of deficiency should never be endured over prolonged periods or it can result in irreversible damage to skeletal structure and even infertility. Luckily, Copper deficiency in humans is rare, but it has been known to happen under the right circumstances. There are other symptoms such as bone fractures, low body temperature, increased susceptibility to viruses and sickness, irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, and even birth defects. Copper deficiency can also be an inherited characteristic though this too, is very rare. This is known otherwise as Menke’s disease and causes afflicted infants to be unable to appropriately or effectively absorb Copper.

It is unknown as to whether or not this acid can directly cause cardiovascular problems or whether it is merely one more risk factor, but there is a correlation between high levels of Homocysteine and cardiovascular problems. Betaine Anhydrous is known for being able to regulate levels of Homocysteine present in the blood and keep them lower regardless of whether it is a direct cause or not. Other than this, Betaine Anhydrous also assists in the production of Carnitine, which assists in the protection of the kidneys.  Health Benefits Provided By Betaine Anhydrous  Anyone that has high levels of Homocysteine in their blood stream is a perfect candidate for trying out a Betaine Anhydrous supplement. It helps regulate the levels of this potentially harmful acid and keep them down low. It also helps keep the intestinal system fully functional and assists in the production of new cells. Because Betaine Anhydrous also has the effect of increasing levels of Carnitine, this means that it is perfect for those interested in physical fitness since it is the chemical Carnitine which allows fat to be burned more efficiently and have more if it harvested for energy to keep the body well fueled. Therefore, anyone interested in gaining muscle mass while also keeping their general levels of fitness up should take this supplement in conjunction with Creatine Ethyl Ester Malate, Creatine Monohydrate, or Creatine Ethyl Ester. ;BulkSupplements;BATMG-25KG;;;57.4225;

It is water soluble and it is vital in sustaining life. It resists the effects of those elements which may cause erosion such as wind, heat, light, alkali, and acids. Its appearance is in the form of white powder with crystalline grains. Both Niacinamide and Niacin are soluble in alcohol and water, and are quite rapidly absorbed into the digestive system once consumed. The body often won't store extra amounts of these vitamins within the liver\; however the majority of it is usually expelled during urination. One of the most important roles of Niacin is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins, hence the term “Niacin flush” which it is sometimes associated with, and the reason that Niacin is often found in such high stores in the liver, the detoxification center of the body. It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. These reactions include, but are not limited to processes which strengthen cell integrity and also produce energy for the body to use, meaning that without Niacin, the body would operate much more slowly, would be much weaker, and would also not be able to build many energy reserves. Through this indirect influence it helps the production of DNA, in the breakdown and metabolizing of fats, and in the general maturation of each individual cell. The body is often in great need of Niacin, and being able to provide this level of Niacin can be difficult without correct dietary scheduling. Foods that are high in protein are a great source of Niacin because the body can later convert amino acids such as Tryptophan (one that is found in high stores in turkey) into Niacin. Some foods which are great sources of Niacin include fish, poultry, eggs, beans, and other dairy. Niacin also blocks fats from making their way into the blood stream to some extent, so there is not such a high content of free-roaming fats in the blood stream. Because of this ability, anyone that is taking medications which alter the amount of fat in the blood should consult a doctor before use, lest the effects of this supplement exacerbate the effectiveness of their medication.    Health Benefits Provided by Niacin  Taking Niacin at about 20mg per day or more has been shown in many scientific tests to increase overall metabolism. Taking too much Niacin can over time cause a slowdown or stoppage of the body’s breakdown of fats. Niacin is an excellent supplement for vegetarians, vegans, and people who frequently consume alcohol. This is because diets that are low on meat are also low on Niacin since some of the largest stores of Niacin come from Tryptophan. Also, taking too much alcohol can inhibit the body’s ability to correctly absorb Niacin. Therefore, these demographics may benefit from taking an additional Niacin supplement to help even out their dietary lack of Vitamin B3. Niacin deficiency is actually quite prevalent among Americans, with symptoms including dementia, canker sores, gastrointestinal problems, low blood sugar, muscle tension and pains, inflammation of the skin, insomnia, fatigue, digestion problems, dizziness, headaches, and a whole host of other problems. Pellagra is a fatal disease which is often associated with extreme Niacin deficiency in the diet. This can result in debilitating mental issues, skin problems and additional gastrointestinal symptoms if left untreated. The best way to prevent this from occurring is to keep up Niacin levels in the body. ;BulkSupplements;NIA-100;;;0.2200;

The latter is the active ingredient in milk thistle and is the element that gives it its antioxidant and liver protecting properties. Silymarin protects the liver by stopping the release of enzymes which are known to be toxic to the liver. In addition, it also has the ability to permanently alter the membrane surrounding a cell to prevent any outside chemicals or toxins from entering and infecting them. Milk Thistle contains beta hydrochloride which enhances the already strong protective elements of Milk Thistle. Silymarin also enhances protein synthesis in the liver and slows the oxidizing process of Glutathione.  Health Benefits Provided by Milk Thistle  Milk Thistle has very powerful antioxidant properties which even give the prominently recognized Vitamins E and C a run for their money.

This antidepressant property of St. John's Wort can also be used to treat the symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder or winter blues, fatigue, lethargy and low energy levels. Contrary to previous studies which stated that it is unclear whether it is Hyperforin or Hypericin that is responsible for the antidepressant property of St. John's Wort, recent experiments have concluded that Hyperforin is the main ingredient associated with the antidepressant effect of St. John's Wort St. John's Wort is used to treat wounds and severe injury. It contains antibacterial components that protect and heal the injured parts of the body from bacterial infection and further trauma.

It is used as an additive in food to impart that tart flavor into various dishes, aside from its main usage as a supplement with health benefits. It can also be used as a preservative and a way to soften water. Calcium Citrate and Calcium Carbonate both contain Calcium, but while Calcium Carbonate may be the most popularly used form of Calcium supplement, this does not make it accessible to everyone. Calcium Citrate is a perfect alternative to Calcium Carbonate for those that have weak or sensitive stomachs, or other gastrointestinal disorders, since the Calcium Carbonate is more likely to cause stomach upset when used. Calcium Citrate may even be fully digested by people that have a gastric acid deficiency in their bodies. Because Calcium is found the most throughout the human body of any other mineral, it is absolutely essential to maintain high levels of Calcium in order for the body to function properly. Osteoporosis, or as it is sometimes called, 'brittle bone syndrome', is caused when there is a Calcium deficiency in the body. Whenever levels of Calcium have hit a low, Calcium will actually be extracted from the bones to redistribute throughout the body in an attempt to level out. Processes such as blood clotting and nerve impulse transmission need to be fueled by Calcium in order to operate properly. On top of that Calcium is also important for the purposes of maintaining strong bones and teeth as well as muscle contraction. Calcium can also be useful in the binding and neutralization of generally harmful molecules in the body. One of the largest sources of Calcium is in dairy, with just one small serving of dairy containing about 300mg, or one fourth of the total daily value for Calcium. However, Calcium is also found in many other natural sources such as seaweed, nuts, legumes, and quinoa. Despite its wide distribution throughout the food pyramid, some people still suffer from Hypocalcemia (or Vitamin D deficiency) which causes issues with Calcium absorption. This is because Calcium can only be correctly absorbed by the body with the help of Vitamin D. A good Calcium rich diet or supplement routine should still include appropriate levels of Vitamin D in it for this reason.    Health Benefits Provided by Calcium Citrate  As mentioned before, Calcium is an essential ingredient in the processes of blood coagulation, proper energy production, and glandular secretion. It also helps in keeping up strong bones, unstained teeth and efficient functioning of the immune system.  ;BulkSupplements;CALCITR-250;;;0.5510;

It is used as an additive in food to impart that tart flavor into various dishes, aside from its main usage as a supplement with health benefits. It can also be used as a preservative and a way to soften water. Calcium Citrate and Calcium Carbonate both contain Calcium, but while Calcium Carbonate may be the most popularly used form of Calcium supplement, this does not make it accessible to everyone. Calcium Citrate is a perfect alternative to Calcium Carbonate for those that have weak or sensitive stomachs, or other gastrointestinal disorders, since the Calcium Carbonate is more likely to cause stomach upset when used. Calcium Citrate may even be fully digested by people that have a gastric acid deficiency in their bodies. Because Calcium is found the most throughout the human body of any other mineral, it is absolutely essential to maintain high levels of Calcium in order for the body to function properly. Osteoporosis, or as it is sometimes called, 'brittle bone syndrome', is caused when there is a Calcium deficiency in the body. Whenever levels of Calcium have hit a low, Calcium will actually be extracted from the bones to redistribute throughout the body in an attempt to level out. Processes such as blood clotting and nerve impulse transmission need to be fueled by Calcium in order to operate properly. On top of that Calcium is also important for the purposes of maintaining strong bones and teeth as well as muscle contraction. Calcium can also be useful in the binding and neutralization of generally harmful molecules in the body. One of the largest sources of Calcium is in dairy, with just one small serving of dairy containing about 300mg, or one fourth of the total daily value for Calcium. However, Calcium is also found in many other natural sources such as seaweed, nuts, legumes, and quinoa. Despite its wide distribution throughout the food pyramid, some people still suffer from Hypocalcemia (or Vitamin D deficiency) which causes issues with Calcium absorption. This is because Calcium can only be correctly absorbed by the body with the help of Vitamin D. A good Calcium rich diet or supplement routine should still include appropriate levels of Vitamin D in it for this reason.    Health Benefits Provided by Calcium Citrate  As mentioned before, Calcium is an essential ingredient in the processes of blood coagulation, proper energy production, and glandular secretion. It also helps in keeping up strong bones, unstained teeth and efficient functioning of the immune system.  ;BulkSupplements;CALCITR-25KG;;;57.4225;

;Caffeine Powder (Synthetic) - 25kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/caffeine-powder-anhydrous.html;CPS-25KG;633.72;;men, women;857281003394;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_291.jpg;This synthetic Caffeine powder is a particular kind of psychoactive stimulant called Trimexylxanthine, which is a part of the larger Xanthine family. These are naturally occurring and are found in a few different plants. Caffeine sends a shock to the central nervous system thereby stimulating it and ridding the mind of feelings of tiredness. Some of the most common sources of Caffeine are in sports drinks, energy drinks, tea, coffee, chocolate, anything containing guarana, and most soft drinks.  BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CAFFEINE POWDER  Caffeine provides an almost instantaneous increase to general alertness and is useful in many situations in which one may need to temporarily give their own energy levels a quick boost. Of course, cognitive functions still need real sleep to be fully restored, so Caffeine should not be used as a substitute for a good night’s sleep. However it is quite useful in situations in which sleep may not be possible for some time. Caffeine is also an ingredient found in many diet pills because of its effects on exercise and digestion. Not only does Caffeine help to quell large appetites to some degree, it also acts as a diuretic helping rid the body of excess water weight\; it helps burn calories in a small way, and its energy increasing effects are helpful to athletes that wish to continue their exercise regimen despite feelings of tiredness that naturally coincide with strenuous exercise. Of course, these effects are not meant to replace exercise, but to increase the effectiveness of a well rounded exercise and diet plan. Caffeine alone will not be enough to stimulate weight loss.;BulkSupplements;CPS-25KG;;;57.5000;

Acetylcholine also helps transmit nerve impulses from points of contact directly to the brain. Converted by the brain, Choline can later become Phosphatidylcholine, which is essential in adding an extra layer of protection to cell membranes. DMAE Bitartrate is useful for bodybuilders and other types of athletes, too because it helps increase overall rates of energy production in the body as well as helping to increase lean muscle mass. This translates into a great performance enhancer for anyone involved in just about any kind of athletics. ;BulkSupplements;DMAE-25KG;;;57.4225;

This means that Inositol is what passes electrical energy through the cellular membrane where it can be used to facilitate many bodily reactions such as the creation of energy and regular cellular maintenance. In addition to that it has the ability to transport fats away from the liver. Inositol can be found at various levels in many different types of foods including breakfast cereal, nuts, anything with bran, meats, whole grains, and many types of fruit, with oranges and cantaloupes containing the highest concentrations of Inositol. Inositol is necessary to be taken daily in order for a certain level of health to be maintained.

Health Benefits Provided By Inositol  Inositol is needed to maintain the integrity of the cellular membrane, especially in those cells located in the bone marrow, brain, intestines, and eyes. It does this by keeping track of what comes in and out of a cell, letting in helpful nutrients and impulses while blocking toxins and other harmful things. Inositol also has the effect of releasing Calcium content present in a cell. It moves fats from the liver and throughout cells that need it, and its most important function is found in the central nervous system since this seems to be where the highest concentrations of Inositol are found.  ;BulkSupplements;VB8-5KG;;;11.0231;

This means that Inositol is what passes electrical energy through the cellular membrane where it can be used to facilitate many bodily reactions such as the creation of energy and regular cellular maintenance. In addition to that it has the ability to transport fats away from the liver. Inositol can be found at various levels in many different types of foods including breakfast cereal, nuts, anything with bran, meats, whole grains, and many types of fruit, with oranges and cantaloupes containing the highest concentrations of Inositol. Inositol is necessary to be taken daily in order for a certain level of health to be maintained.

Since Sulfur is so prevalent in the bodies of living organisms, this makes it a part of at least 150 compounds that can be found in the body including proteins, hormones, and even more physically prominent aspects such as skin and hair.

As a bonus, Spirulina acts as a great source of Vitamin B12, essential fatty acids, Beta Carotene, and Chlorophyll. Some of these elements are only present in high amounts in the diets of meat eaters and other nutrients like Beta-Carotene and Chlorophyll are useful in that they help the body get rid of toxins and act as antioxidants which further promote a healthy immune system by getting rid of free radicals. Also, even though carrots are generally credited with being one of the richest sources of Beta-Carotene, as it turns out, the amount in Spirulina is ten times that which is in carrots. Because of the amount of nutrients in it which are present in meat and which most people usually receive from meat in their own personal diets\; Spirulina has been the number one choice in supplements for people with a vegetarian diet. It even has these nutrients in quantities that are sufficient enough to use it as a regular supplement (in other words, you need not eat thirty six spoonfuls of Spirulina to get the effect of one forkful of steak, they level out just about. It even has more protein in it then soybeans which are traditionally cited as the best source of protein when on a vegetarian diet.   Health Benefits Provided by Spirulina  Spirulina has such positive nutritional content that it is called the world’s richest whole food which can be found naturally. Not only that, but it is sometimes called “green food” as well due to the fact that it has such an enormous amount of healthy minerals in it and it also has such low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram). And if using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than 3/4 the amount of calories in protein per gram. Due to the large amount of Iron in Spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does Spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body’s ability to absorb protein. This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. In this way, Spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meat. Spirulina contains a concentration of very essential amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but that we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina is thus, the one stop shop for essential amino acids which help to repair the body when it is damaged in any way and keep it running regularly. Those who have a poor diet which is mostly made up of processed foods such as chips and microwaveable meals, as well as those people that identify as vegetarian or vegan should all consider taking this supplement to make up for the nutrients that their diet is lacking. Taking Spirulina has never resulted in toxic effects according to any reports. ;BulkSupplements;SPIR-250;;;0.5510;

As far as supplemental sources are concerned, D-Calcium Pantothenate is the most popular source of this vitamin since it is much more stable than Pantothenic Acid bound to Calcium. Absorption of this source into the digestive tract is much simpler as well. Just about every single fruit and vegetable has some amount of Pantothenic Acid in it (which is what gave the acid it’s name, as in the original Greek, “Pantos” means everywhere), with the best sources being chicken, milk, beef, and mushrooms. Pantothenic Acid is particularly important because of its relation to Coenzyme A. The body converts Pantothenic Acid into Pantethine. Pantethine is a building block of CoA, which itself is important in supporting various bodily functions including The Krebs Cycle, as well as the conversion of various nutrients, proteins, sugars, and fat into energy that the body can use. It also helps to destroy toxins in the liver and break down drugs as well as synthesizing Cholesterol, Choline, and Melatonin. Another chemical resulting indirectly from the breakdown of Pantothenic Acid in the body is ACP. ACP helps to protect nerves from being damaged easily.  Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin B5  The presence of Pantothenic Acid throughout the body allows bodily growth to keep up at a normal level, letting all normal bodily functions to run smoothly. Pantothenic Acid is also instrumental when it comes to creating energy through the metabolic process. It also helps break down essential amino acids and fatty acids into components that can actually be used by the body. This is part of what gives it the capability of keeping the digestive tract in shape and improving the effectiveness of other vitamins consumed. It is hard to find true cases of Pantogenic Acid deficiency since rich sources of Pantogenic Acid are found just about everywhere\; however, this can be a problem for people that are going through starvation. The symptoms of Vitamin B5 deficiency include tiredness, depression, cramps, heart anomalies, numbness, insomnia, and mood swings.

As far as supplemental sources are concerned, D-Calcium Pantothenate is the most popular source of this vitamin since it is much more stable than Pantothenic Acid bound to Calcium. Absorption of this source into the digestive tract is much simpler as well. Just about every single fruit and vegetable has some amount of Pantothenic Acid in it (which is what gave the acid it’s name, as in the original Greek, “Pantos” means everywhere), with the best sources being chicken, milk, beef, and mushrooms. Pantothenic Acid is particularly important because of its relation to Coenzyme A. The body converts Pantothenic Acid into Pantethine. Pantethine is a building block of CoA, which itself is important in supporting various bodily functions including The Krebs Cycle, as well as the conversion of various nutrients, proteins, sugars, and fat into energy that the body can use. It also helps to destroy toxins in the liver and break down drugs as well as synthesizing Cholesterol, Choline, and Melatonin. Another chemical resulting indirectly from the breakdown of Pantothenic Acid in the body is ACP. ACP helps to protect nerves from being damaged easily.  Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin B5  The presence of Pantothenic Acid throughout the body allows bodily growth to keep up at a normal level, letting all normal bodily functions to run smoothly. Pantothenic Acid is also instrumental when it comes to creating energy through the metabolic process. It also helps break down essential amino acids and fatty acids into components that can actually be used by the body. This is part of what gives it the capability of keeping the digestive tract in shape and improving the effectiveness of other vitamins consumed. It is hard to find true cases of Pantogenic Acid deficiency since rich sources of Pantogenic Acid are found just about everywhere\; however, this can be a problem for people that are going through starvation.

Sometimes Biotin is even referred to as Vitamin B7, or even Vitamin H, and in some cases Coenzyme R. Biotin is involved in the essential process of turning fatty acids, sugars such as glucose, and amino acids into energy that the body can use as fuel. Biotin also plays a key role in the body’s manufacture of carboxylase enzymes which regulate the healthy growth and appearance of hair follicles and skin. In addition Biotin helps maintain healthy blood cells and bone marrow as well as strong nerve tissue. Biotin can be found naturally in the human body in small quantities. It is usually located and stored in the brain, muscle, and liver. There is also a small amount of the body’s Biotin which is directly synthesized in the intestine via the bacteria present inside that regulates daily production and need. However, this is a small amount, and in order to truly have a balanced and healthy diet, Biotin must be found in meals every once in a while. It can be found in dishes that include egg yolk, liver, nuts, grainy cereals, beans, and legumes. While processed foods may still contain some level of Biotin, if altering diet specifically for increased Biotin intake it may be best to stick with less processed foods, as the heat involved in cooking and maintaining freshness of these processed food items may inadvertently kill a lot of the Biotin available in these sources. The fresher the foods are, the higher the levels of Biotin that will be found in them.   Health Benefits Provided By Biotin 1%  Biotin’s main use for the human body is its ability to act as a Coenzyme during the synthesis process for a wide array of different enzymes involved in metabolizing nutrients including sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This makes Biotin essential in the conversion of all of these energy sources into the resulting energy that they would create to then fuel the body. It also correctly allows the body to use blood sugar for the purposes of energy consumption. If one is deficient in levels of Biotin, this will become obvious due to symptoms such as hair loss, as well as a rash that can be seen anywhere from the eyes, the mouth, the nose, or the genitals. The less obvious neurological issues that may be caused by Biotin deficiency range from depression and lethargy to hallucinations, and the extremities feeling numb. The unique kind of rash that Biotin deficiency can result in is so iconic that some medical professionals may refer to it as Biotin deficient face right off the bat.

It assists in the manufacture of carboxylase enzymes which ensure that skin cells and hair follicles are well maintained and grow at a healthy rate. Biotin also keeps the bone marrow, nerve tissues, and blood cells healthy and strong. It can be found in small pockets throughout the body in locations such as the brain, muscles, and liver. It can also be naturally synthesized to some extent within the human body by the bacteria located in the intestines. This allows small amounts of Biotin to be circulated throughout the body daily and to be used for day to day needs. It is normally found in foods such as egg yolk, certain types of cereal, nuts, beans, and liver. While Biotin can handle being stored in heat and light, the heat involved in the cooking process can cause Biotin-rich foods to lose their stores of Biotin upon extended exposure. In other words, processed foods, even if they originally contained high levels of Biotin,  this will be a poor source of it. Higher levels of Biotin are found in fresh foods and thus, will provide greater benefits to overall health.  Health Benefits Provided by Biotin  Biotin is a Coenzyme for several important enzymes that are essential in the process of metabolizing various fats, sugars, and proteins, and converting this output into energy to be used to fuel the body. Taking Biotin as a supplement, its primary use is to help to strengthen nails and hair. It can actually help to repair brittle or cracking nails and hair follicles, and contribute to a general level of overall health once these are repaired. Biotin deficiency can be caused by several things, by prolonged exposure to anti-seizure medication or antibiotics, or by the excessive consumption of raw egg whites which contain a protein that binds with, and neutralizes, Biotin. This deficiency shows itself in the form of hair loss or a red rash that may surround the eyes, mouth, nose, or genitals. The neurological effects that Biotin deficiency may have can be milder such as tiredness or depression, and they can be much worse such as numbness of the extremities as well as terrifying hallucinations.  ;BulkSupplements;PURBIO-10;;;0.0220;

It assists in the manufacture of carboxylase enzymes which ensure that skin cells and hair follicles are well maintained and grow at a healthy rate. Biotin also keeps the bone marrow, nerve tissues, and blood cells healthy and strong. It can be found in small pockets throughout the body in locations such as the brain, muscles, and liver. It can also be naturally synthesized to some extent within the human body by the bacteria located in the intestines. This allows small amounts of Biotin to be circulated throughout the body daily and to be used for day to day needs. It is normally found in foods such as egg yolk, certain types of cereal, nuts, beans, and liver. While Biotin can handle being stored in heat and light, the heat involved in the cooking process can cause Biotin-rich foods to lose their stores of Biotin upon extended exposure. In other words, processed foods, even if they originally contained high levels of Biotin,  this will be a poor source of it. Higher levels of Biotin are found in fresh foods and thus, will provide greater benefits to overall health.  Health Benefits Provided by Biotin  Biotin is a Coenzyme for several important enzymes that are essential in the process of metabolizing various fats, sugars, and proteins, and converting this output into energy to be used to fuel the body.

These coenzymes act upon ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and help transport it throughout the body. In this way, riboflavin becomes important in two different facets of energy production, as ATP is the chemical that allows energy to both be created and stored in the muscles for later. Riboflavin helps cells utilize oxygen better and keeps the eyes sharp, and the nails, hair, and skin growing like a charm. It is a necessary component in the process that leads to cells growing. Because Riboflavin is in so many different foods, someone that eats a well balanced diet probably has no need to supplement Riboflavin. Some of the more abundant sources of this vitamin include tongue and organ meats, seaweed, fish with heavy oil content in their bodies such as mackerel, herring, eel, and trout, and brewer’s yeast. Riboflavin may also be found in dairy including eggs, and milk, along with whole grains, enriched cereals, broccoli and other green veggies. The body does store a small amount of Riboflavin in the kidneys and the liver, but not enough to sustain the body. It must be regularly consumed to continue being healthy. Vitamin B1 and B3 have serious health concerns brought on when the subject is deficient in these vitamins. Specific diseases of a severe nature are associated with deficiency in each one. Luckily, while Vitamin B2 deficiency may result in side effects, there are no specific diseases related to it.  Health Benefits Provided by Riboflavin  Riboflavin directly facilitates the growth of blood cells and it lends strength to the immune system in that it has antioxidant properties that neutralize free radicals before they can cause serious damage. As stated above, Riboflavin also promotes the growth of hair and nails and keeps the skin healthy. Riboflavin also acts upon both folate and pantothenic acid, two of the most crucial neurotransmitters associated with the development of memory and overall cognitive abilities. Those women that have been prescribed oral contraceptives, and people who take excessive amounts of alcohol may want to consider supplementing for Riboflavin as both of these elements may cause a reduction in the body’s ability to correctly absorb Riboflavin. In addition, the elderly and diabetics may have trouble absorbing Riboflavin\; and those who are lactose intolerant since dairy is such a big supplier of Riboflavin.

Riboflavin may also be found in dairy including eggs, and milk, along with whole grains, enriched cereals, broccoli and other green veggies. The body does store a small amount of Riboflavin in the kidneys and the liver, but not enough to sustain the body. It must be regularly consumed to continue being healthy. Vitamin B1 and B3 have serious health concerns brought on when the subject is deficient in these vitamins. Specific diseases of a severe nature are associated with deficiency in each one. Luckily, while Vitamin B2 deficiency may result in side effects, there are no specific diseases related to it.  Health Benefits Provided by Riboflavin  Riboflavin directly facilitates the growth of blood cells and it lends strength to the immune system in that it has antioxidant properties that neutralize free radicals before they can cause serious damage. As stated above, Riboflavin also promotes the growth of hair and nails and keeps the skin healthy. Riboflavin also acts upon both folate and pantothenic acid, two of the most crucial neurotransmitters associated with the development of memory and overall cognitive abilities. Those women that have been prescribed oral contraceptives, and people who take excessive amounts of alcohol may want to consider supplementing for Riboflavin as both of these elements may cause a reduction in the body’s ability to correctly absorb Riboflavin. In addition, the elderly and diabetics may have trouble absorbing Riboflavin\; and those who are lactose intolerant since dairy is such a big supplier of Riboflavin. If you fit into any of these groups you may want to consider taking a riboflavin supplement.  ;BulkSupplements;RIBO-5KG;;;11.0231;

It keeps all metabolic functions in the body running smoothly and correctly. It keeps the cardiovascular system running in good health and makes sure that the rate of your heart beat stays regular. The nervous system as well as cognitive systems would not be nearly as functional without a good dose of Vitamin B1 consistently running through the veins. This supplement comes in the form of a crystalline powder with a slightly off-white or almost yellow hue. Thiamine is easily soluble in water and because the body is constantly cycling it out through the urinary tract, it needs to continually be replaced through diet or supplementation. This substance reacts easily to heat and alkali when these components are added to the solution. Because the vitamin is so popular and so necessary to sustain life it can be found in an abundance of different natural foods, however a synthetic man-made version is also available for purchase. Some of the richer sources of Vitamin B1 include oranges, sunflower seeds, asparagus, baked potatoes, raisins, various meats, beef and organ meats, wheat bread, and brown rice and fortified cereals just to name a few. There are several types of natural Thiamine phosphate that can be found naturally, and this form is mainly utilized due to its ability to aid transportation throughout the body. The derivatives of this principle Thiamine can mainly be synthesized through various reactions in the body, and each for goes on to assist with other functions in the body such as metabolism of various nutrients, fats, carbohydrates etc. These forms of Thiamine act as a co-factor to many enzymatic reactions that are deemed necessary in order to keep the body working correctly. Thiamine forms new blood when needed and also keeps enough neurotransmitters firing regularly that it keeps the brain alert and well stimulated. It has a mostly beneficial effect on just about everything from general cognitive ability to a healthy appetite, to production of hormones and energy, etc. As far as bodily locations of Thiamine are concerned, the largest deposits of this vitamin are located in the most important organs of the body including the liver, kidneys, heart, and brain\; however they do also collect in the muscles. The name Vitamin B1 was given to Thiamine not because it was the first vitamin to have ever been discovered, but because it was the first to have been classified in a group of what we now refer to as vitamins. A healthy diet will have large amounts of Vitamin B1 present in it and this diet needs to take into account a large portion of Vitamin B1 on a daily basis since it is so often expelled through the urine. This is possibly the best reason to supplement, because it makes scheduling servings of Vitamin B1 so much easier rather than having to worry whether one food has it or not. The body does not routinely store Vitamin B1 anywhere so this is why it is best to take multiple servings per day.  Health Benefits Provided by Thiamine  As stated above, it would be impossible for metabolism to occur without the presence of Thiamine. This goes for most types of metabolism including the main kind, metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the interest of using them as energy. Vitamin B1 is essential in the production of ATP which the body needs in order to store energy for later if a very trying exercise were to occur or for that matter, if any physical activity is necessary at all. Vitamin B1 has a strong effect on the way that blood is formed. It also protects the kidneys, liver heart, circulatory system, brain, and digestive system safe and intact, free of pain or misery while at the same time regulating growth in the body and certain hormonal secretions. Thiamine has antioxidant properties which allow it to keep the body free from damage by harmful free radicals.;BulkSupplements;B1HCL-100;;;0.2200;

There are several types of natural Thiamine phosphate that can be found naturally, and this form is mainly utilized due to its ability to aid transportation throughout the body. The derivatives of this principle Thiamine can mainly be synthesized through various reactions in the body, and each for goes on to assist with other functions in the body such as metabolism of various nutrients, fats, carbs etc. These forms of Thiamine act as a co-factor to many enzymatic reactions that are deemed necessary in order to keep the body working correctly. Thiamine forms new blood when needed and also keeps enough neurotransmitters firing regularly that it keeps the brain alert and well stimulated. It has a mostly beneficial effect on just about everything from general cognitive ability to a healthy appetite, to production of hormones and energy etc. As far as bodily locations of Thiamine are concerned, the largest deposits of this vitamin are located in the most important organs of the body including the liver, kidneys, heart, and brain\; however they do also collect in the muscles. The name Vitamin B1 was given to Thiamine not because it was the first vitamin to have ever been discovered, but because it was the first to have been classified in a group of what we now refer to as vitamins. A healthy diet will have large amounts of Vitamin B1 present in it and this diet needs to take into account a large portion of Vitamin B1 on a daily basis since it is so often expelled through the urine. This is possibly the best reason to supplement, because it makes scheduling servings of Vitamin B1 so much easier rather than having to worry whether one food has it or not. The body does not routinely store Vitamin B1 anywhere so this is why it is best to take multiple servings per day.  Health Benefits Provided by Thiamine  As stated above, it would be impossible for metabolism to occur without the presence of Thiamine. This goes for most types of metabolism including the main kind, metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the interest of using them as energy. Vitamin B1 is essential in the production of ATP which the body needs in order to store energy for later if a very trying exercise were to occur\; or for that matter, if any physical activity is necessary at all. Vitamin B1 has a strong effect on the way that blood is formed. It also protects the kidneys, liver heart, circulatory system, brain, and digestive system safe and intact, free of pain or misery while at the same time regulating growth in the body and certain hormonal secretions. Thiamine has antioxidant properties which allow it to keep the body free from damage by harmful free radicals. ;BulkSupplements;B1TM-500;;;1.1020;

It is Gastric IF which allows Vitamin B12 to be taken into the blood, rather than simply being lost through the digestion process. This is how it is eventually stored, meaning that having a condition which causes a shortage of IF for whatever reason, will eventually result in lowered amounts of Vitamin B12 in the body. The nerve cells need Vitamin B12 to function appropriately since Vitamin B12 is responsible for producing the chemical which allows for DNA and RNA replication to take place. Like most B-chain vitamins, Vitamin B12 is known to work better when used along with other B-chain vitamins, specifically Vitamin B9. This helps the creation and regulation of blood cells to go much more smoothly and also prevents anemia from occurring. Vitamin B12 indirectly assists the facilitation of certain enzymes which go on to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids. This means that Vitamin B12 is necessary for metabolism whether it is indirect or not. Vitamin B12 can be found in many different foods as a natural component. Of course because of its affiliation with protein, this mainly means that it is located in animal products for the most part. It can be found in most fish meats, beef, and poultry, and can also be found in a lot of dairy products. Excluding fortified foods, the only sources of Vitamin B12 that might be considered reliable are sources from dairy or meat. Vitamin B12 is released during digestion because it is bound to proteins and must be broken down by stomach acids in order for it to be released. Therefore if someone has weak stomach acid or a reduced gastric acid output this means it will be hard to get the necessary daily value of Vitamin B12 from natural sources. This is why multivitamins and supplements exist.   Health Benefits Provided by Vitamin B12  The main thing that Vitamin B12 is known for is being able to create new red blood cells. Vitamin B12 also helps to maintain the health of the nervous system and create and replicate DNA and RNA, the building blocks of cells. Vitamin B12 directly helps the nervous system by metabolizing fatty acids in a certain way which aids in the production of Myelin. Myelin is a special coating that covers nerve endings. If the Myelin sheath coating the nerves is compromised in any way it will lead to irreversible damage to the  nervous system, especially if the lack of exposure to copious amounts of Vitamin B12 takes place over a prolonged period. Having too much homocysteine in the body is generally seen as a negative thing because of its potential to cause damage to blood cells. Vitamin B9 and B12 are both credited with being able to cause the levels of homocysteine in the blood to be kept at lower amounts.;BulkSupplements;B12PC-10;;;0.0220;

Vitamin B12 directly helps the nervous system by metabolizing fatty acids in a certain way which aids in the production of Myelin. Myelin is a special coating that covers nerve endings. If the Myelin sheath coating the nerves is compromised in any way it will lead to irreversible damage to the  nervous system, especially if the lack of exposure to copious amounts of Vitamin B12 takes place over a prolonged period. Having too much homocysteine in the body is generally seen as a negative thing because of its potential to cause damage to blood cells. Vitamin B9 and B12 are both credited with being able to cause the levels of homocysteine in the blood to be kept at lower amounts.;BulkSupplements;B12PC-1KG;;;2.2050;

This is especially true for foods that are rich in protein since the Vitamin B12 is meant to bind to protein molecules. HCL in the stomach acid then breaks down the foods, allowing the Vitamin B12 to be released from the proteins and then go on to help the body use the newly digested food as energy. Vitamin B12, once consumed, is incorporated by the body with a substance called Gastric IF (which stands for intrinsic factor) and then taken into the intestinal tract. It is Gastric IF which allows Vitamin B12 to be taken into the blood rather than simply being lost through the digestion process. This is how it is eventually stored, which means that having a condition which causes a shortage of IF for whatever reason, will eventually result in lowered amounts of Vitamin B12 in the body. The nerve cells need Vitamin B12 to function appropriately since Vitamin B12 is responsible for producing the chemical which allows for DNA and RNA replication to take place. Like most B-chain vitamins, Vitamin B12 is known to work better when used along with other B-chain vitamins, specifically Vitamin B9. This helps the creation and regulation of blood cells go much more smoothly and also prevents anemia from occurring. Vitamin B12 indirectly assists the facilitation of certain enzymes which go on to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids. This means that Vitamin B12 is necessary for metabolism whether it is indirect or not. Vitamin B12 can be found in many different foods as a natural component. Of course because of its affiliation with protein, this mainly means that it is located in animal products for the most part. It can be found in most fish meats, beef, and poultry, and can also be found in a lot of dairy products. Excluding fortified foods, the only sources of Vitamin B12 that might be considered reliable are sources from dairy or meat. Vitamin B12 is released during digestion because it is bound to proteins and must be broken down by stomach acids in order for it to be released.

These coenzymes have been named NAD and NADH respectively. Taken in amounts of about 100mg or less, both Niacin and Niacinamide ostensibly perform the same actions. When taken at levels greater than 100mg though, this is where their overall effects begin to differ. Niacin is able to help the body balance the levels of good and bad cholesterol present in the blood, while Niacinamide is essential in monitoring insulin levels, blood sugar content, and health of joints. Niacinamide may also be used along with other supplements and minerals to increase the overall effectiveness and health of the nervous system, the digestive system and the circulatory system. Of all of the B vitamins, Niacin is considered to be one of the most stable. It is water soluble and it is vital in sustaining life. It resists the effects of those elements which may cause erosion such as wind, heat, light, alkali, and acids. Both Niacinamide and Niacin are soluble in alcohol and water, and are quite rapidly absorbed into the digestive system once consumed. The body often won't to store extra amounts of these vitamins within the liver\; however the majority of it is usually expelled during urination. One of the most important roles of Niacinamide is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins. Hence the term “Niacin flush” which it is sometimes associated with and the reason that Niacinamide is often found in such high stores in the liver, the detoxification center of the body. It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain sex based hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. These reactions include, but are not limited to processes which strengthen cell integrity and also produce energy for the body to use\; meaning that without Niacin or Niacinamide, the body would operate much more slowly, would be much weaker, and would also not be able to build many energy reserves. Through this indirect influence it helps the production of DNA, in the breakdown and metabolizing of fats, and in the general maturation of each individual cell. Pellagra, a disease that occurs as a result of Niacin deficiency, may be treated by Niacinamide. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of Niacinamide use is the fact that it can be used to synthesize HCL, an acid which is essential in the digestive process.  Health Benefits Provided by Niacinamide  Niacinamide is indirectly involved in the production of cellular energy. It also keeps blood flow going smoothly and controls hormones as well as Glucose levels and HCL in the body\; which helps to further positively affect energy production, nervous system operation, and digestion. Niacinamide affects the flexibility and health of the skin and improves the effectiveness of the circulatory system by widening the blood vessels, thereby distributing blood more rapidly to the parts of the body that need it and getting rid of harmful toxins in the blood much more quickly.  ;BulkSupplements;B3-100;;;0.2200;

These coenzymes have been named NAD and NADH respectively. Taken in amounts of about 100mg or less, both Niacin and Niacinamide ostensibly perform the same actions. When taken at levels greater than 100mg though, this is where their overall effects begin to differ. Niacin is able to help the body balance the levels of good and bad cholesterol present in the blood, while Niacinamide is essential in monitoring insulin levels, blood sugar content, and health of joints. Niacinamide may also be used along with other supplements and minerals to increase the overall effectiveness and health of the nervous system, the digestive system and the circulatory system. Of all of the B vitamins, Niacin is considered to be one of the most stable. It is water soluble and it is vital in sustaining life. It resists the effects of those elements which may cause erosion such as wind, heat, light, alkali, and acids. Both Niacinamide and Niacin are soluble in alcohol and water, and are quite rapidly absorbed into the digestive system once consumed. The body often won't to store extra amounts of these vitamins within the liver\; however the majority of it is usually expelled during urination. One of the most important roles of Niacinamide is in its ability to help clear the body of toxins. Hence the term “Niacin flush” which it is sometimes associated with and the reason that Niacinamide is often found in such high stores in the liver, the detoxification center of the body. It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain sex based hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level. These reactions include, but are not limited to processes which strengthen cell integrity and also produce energy for the body to use\; meaning that without Niacin or Niacinamide, the body would operate much more slowly, would be much weaker, and would also not be able to build many energy reserves. Through this indirect influence it helps the production of DNA, in the breakdown and metabolizing of fats, and in the general maturation of each individual cell. Pellagra, a disease that occurs as a result of Niacin deficiency, may be treated by Niacinamide. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of Niacinamide use is the fact that it can be used to synthesize HCL, an acid which is essential in the digestive process.  Health Benefits Provided by Niacinamide  Niacinamide is indirectly involved in the production of cellular energy. It also keeps blood flow going smoothly and controls hormones as well as Glucose levels and HCL in the body\; which helps to further positively affect energy production, nervous system operation, and digestion.

Most refined foods lose Vitamin B6 in the refining process, and even cooking a food will cause most of the Vitamin B6 concentration to be lost if not all. This means foods being taken specifically for their Vitamin B6 content must be stored and prepared appropriately or you risk losing the entire point of them. Pyridoxine may be used immediately after consuming and makes its way quickly from the liver into the blood stream. Anyone who is taking up a diet involving fasting or in any way causing a reduction of food intake will usually also result in the loss of vital Vitamin B6. At the end of the day once you have eaten, most Vitamin B6 consumed will be expelled in the urine, and the rest will have been either used by the body or stored in the muscle. It takes Vitamin B6 about 8 hours to go fully through the system. The highest concentrations of Vitamin B6 are found in organ meats and whole grains\; however dairy products such as eggs and yogurt are appropriate sources as well. Vitamin B6 may also be found in various nuts and legumes, and fruits such as bananas and prunes. Vegetables containing Vitamin B6 include cabbage, potatoes, and cauliflower. This vitamin may also be found in high quantity in avocado.

Vitamin B6 is especially essential for amino acid metabolism and it is also used in the production of GABA. Pyridoxals in general facilitate the metabolism and conversion to energy of all food types and are instrumental in helping to release energy that has been stored for later use in the muscles. It also helps to produce both red blood cells and new antibodies and keeps up synthesis of DNA and RNA. Most amino acids are made up of various proteins and come from foods that are major sources of protein. This means that the effects that Vitamin B6 has on metabolism of amino acids can be extended to proteins in general. Pyridoxals are essential to the metabolism of amino acids and proteins because they are the chemicals that allow amino acids to break through the intestines and actually work their way into the blood stream. Pyridoxine HCL has the ability to build, break down, and alter the form of various amino acids. If one should become deficient in Pyridoxine HCL it is so important to all bodily processes that it will become obvious that this has happened because symptoms will be recognized all throughout the body. The symptoms for Pyridoxal deficiency are actually in line with the symptoms for riboflavin and niacin deficiency as well and include muscle weakness, irritability, nervousness, and depression. ;BulkSupplements;B6-100;;;0.2200;

There are two different sources of the hormone which regulates the body’s production and consumption of calcium. This includes Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) and Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol). However, the latter is generally thought if as an inferior source\; usually found in oily fish, fortified milk and various other dairy and grains. The reason that Vitamin D3 is generally preferred to Vitamin D2 is that it is more easily absorbed by the body, and more commonly found as it is naturally produced and it also has a greater overall effect. Vitamin D levels are moderated by the sunlight, as there is a chemical contained in the skin which can absorb the Vitamin D being radiated out through the sun’s rays. Simply being in the sun for fifteen minutes at a time can supply the body with up to 5,000 IU of Vitamin D. As a fat soluble vitamin, it can also be found in food with high fat content, particularly oily fish and other animal products. Its solubility in oil allows it to be stored in the body to some extent as well.   Health Benefits Provided by Vitamin D3  Not having enough Vitamin D3 in your system can lead to a deficiency which has a variety of negative side effects associated with it. Rickets, a disease resulting in deformation of bones and teeth, is quite common in children that have low Vitamin D3 levels. Adults with low Vitamin D3 can develop a condition called Osteomalacia (a disease with similar effects to Rickets)\; or the more common Osteoporosis, which causes bone weakness as calcium is taken out of the bones steadily and provided to other parts of the body that need it. Vitamin D does not only promote the absorption of calcium but also of magnesium, another mineral essential to good growth. Vitamin D is necessary in the metabolic process of Vitamin A and it is needed for the body to process phosphorous correctly. All of the health benefits that Vitamin D provides to the body are part of one much larger procedure whose main goal is to preserve the density of bone and teeth structures. This vitamin, along with Vitamin A, is useful in treatment of children and of the elderly who have developed Rickets. It may even be useful to women who have just gone through menopause, as menopause can sometimes result in a slight to significant loss of bone density if adequate levels of Vitamin D3 are not maintained.;BulkSupplements;D3-100;;;0.2200;

Beta-Carotene is a carotenoid that has the ability to be converted to retinal, also called retinaldehyde\; the most important chemical in maintaining health eyes and good vision.  There is an emerging evidence as published in the Journal of the American Dietetics Association, that eating fruits and vegetables rich in Beta-Carotene can protect against cancer, stroke, cataract, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and diverticulosis.   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY BETA CAROTENE Beta-Carotene boosts the body's immune system. It protects the body against oxidative stress by trapping and scavenging the free radicals found in the body thus removing the harmful substances that tend to weaken the immune system.   Beta-Carotene protects against lung cancer. Studies show that healthy people who take Beta-Carotene supplements are less likely to develop lung cancer. However, long term smokers who take Beta-Carotene supplements are in danger of causing further damage to their lungs because the toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke promotes the proliferation of cancer cells in the lungs.  Beta-Carotene improves and maintains good vision and eyesight. Together with the other important carotenoids, lutein, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, Beta -Carotene protects the eyes against macular degeneration, by absorbing the harmful ultraviolet light that enters and causes damage to the macula\; the part of human eyes that gives us the clearest vision. ;BulkSupplements;BC8%-25KG;;;55.1160;

Histamine is a chemical that causes allergic reactions in people. Not the type of allergic reactions someone who is allergic to food might have, but those caused by the environment which include symptoms like sneezing and swelling. Though Quercetin provides coloring for many different plants and sources, it can be found in the highest concentrations in citrus fruits, onions, apples, parsley, red wine, and certain kinds of tea. Foods that are generally high in flavonoids that also include Quercetin are dark berries, olive oil, cherries, and grapes. The darker the fruit, the more flavonoids present.  Health Benefits Provided by Quercetin  Quercetin, as an antioxidant, helps protect against free radical damage. Free radicals are harmful molecules in the body that are known for going on the offensive and attacking healthy cells, taking apart their DNA and damaging the cell walls. It also protects blood cells as well. Quercetin enhances the body’s absorption of Vitamin C and allows the content of Vitamin C within the body to proliferate more strongly. This is good because Vitamin c itself is another type of antioxidant.   ;BulkSupplements;QD-25KG;;;57.4225;

It is the chemical compound added to fresh fruits and vegetable to increase their shelf life. Calcium Lactate is used in medicine as a cure for Hyperacidity, and to treat various disorders caused by low levels of calcium in the body. The body contains approximately one kilogram of calcium, the most abundant mineral in the human body. A large amount of that, approximately 99%, is found in the bones and stored as calcium phosphates. As calcium exerts 3 important functions, so does its important component, Calcium Lactate. Calcium which exerts its function in the form of calcium phosphate, is important in supporting the activities of other minerals that help maintain bone mass and structure. Calcium found in and outside the cell is used as an alternative to deliver electric signals among hormones. It stimulates the release of acetylcholine and causes muscle contraction.  HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CALCIUM LACTATE Calcium Lactate can prevent Osteoporosis. It protects pre-menopausal women from the early onset of bone loss  and helps post-menopausal women from encountering possible fatal fractures and falls. It works in conjunction with other minerals to prevent further loss of calcium content in the body and to maintain bone mass and structure.   Calcium Lactate can protect from food poisoning and food spoilage by preventing the rapid growth of bacteria especially in fresh and processed meats and produce.   Calcium Lactate promotes re-mineralization of tooth enamel. This emphasizes the ability of Calcium Lactate to replenish lost minerals from the teeth restoring their shape and structure. ;BulkSupplements;CL-250;;;0.5510;

In this sense it is important in weight loss and in exercising for the specific purpose of burning fat. The fat provides energy via the reaction created by pyruvate, and this in turn creates more energy which can then be used to continue burning more fat. If taking Calcium Pyruvate as a supplement, natural production of pyruvate will not be affected or interrupted in any way. Calcium Pyruvate is able to speed up the delivery taking place between glucose and proteins into cells. This is done through facilitating the creation of new ATP which is responsible for this action. It also aids in increasing overall performance in exercise due to this property.  ;BulkSupplements;CP-100;;;0.2200;

It keeps the heart healthy by dilating the arteries and blood vessels to an acceptable level. Without Magnesium, blood vessels in the body may begin to shrink and cause blood flow throughout the body to be stymied dangerously. Magnesium also helps keep up levels of oral health and immune system efficiency. Magnesium can be found in a wide variety of foods, including beans, nuts, grains, green vegetables especially of the leafy variety, and many types of seafood just to name a few nonspecific areas. Unfortunately, even though Magnesium is found in so many different foods, contemporary diets do not have much room for these specific kinds of foods so it may be prudent to supplement if this is the case for you personally. There can even be situations in which Magnesium is lost much more rapidly than a Magnesium rich diet can make up for. This can be sped up by vomiting, diarrhea, issues involving the intestine’s ability to absorb magnesium correctly, etc.  There are a few different groups of people that are at a higher risk for suffering Magnesium deficiency. This list includes the elderly, people that use diuretics excessively, and diabetics. Women who take “the pill” as a form of contraception are a part of this overarching group to. Many people in these groups could benefit greatly from Magnesium supplementation to increase overall bodily health. It has also been shown that the efficiency of Magnesium supplementation increases greatly when taking Calcium supplements along with it. For best results it is recommended that Magnesium be consumed at a ratio of 1:2 with Calcium.  Health Benefits Provided by Magnesium Carbonate  As it turns out, Magnesium is a necessary component for all cells in the body to function normally. Half of the total Magnesium found in the body is located in tissue, organs, etc., while the other half is found bound with Calcium in the bone. There is a use for all Magnesium. There is a remaining 1% of Magnesium after these calculations are done and this 1% is located in the bloodstream. The body constantly needs to keep the Magnesium content in blood at a balanced level. Magnesium is necessary in three hundred or more different reactions in the body. It also helps keep bones strong and durable, it keeps the heart going at an acceptable pace, and it also establishes the normal function of muscles and nerves. Without Magnesium it would be almost impossible to synthesize or metabolize proteins and energy correctly.  The Carbonate content in Magnesium causes this to be identified as an alkaline. It is often found in antacid brands and is used to assist when an excess of stomach acid is causing abdominal pain. Magnesium Carbonate is also used to absorb water and prevent caking, giving it prominent use in talcum and in some powdery supplements. In fact, Morton brand salt, one of the most popular brands of salt in the world has now been using Magnesium Carbonate in their product for over 100 years to prevent individual granules of salt from sticking together when the atmosphere they were stored in became too humid. Because of its use in talcum powder, it has found much use as a softener and can be found in a few different skin products, especially facial masks.  ;BulkSupplements;MCARB-250;;;0.5510;

Magnesium also helps keep up levels of oral health and immune system efficiency. Magnesium can be found in a wide variety of foods, including beans, nuts, grains, green vegetables especially of the leafy variety, and many types of seafood just to name a few nonspecific areas. Unfortunately, even though Magnesium is found in so many different foods, contemporary diets do not have much room for these specific kinds of foods so it may be prudent to supplement if this is the case for you personally. There are a few different groups of people that are at a higher risk for suffering Magnesium deficiency. This list includes the elderly, people that use diuretics excessively, and diabetics. Women who take “the pill” as a form of contraception are a part of this overarching group too. Many people in these groups could benefit greatly from Magnesium supplementation to increase overall bodily health. It has also been shown that the efficiency of Magnesium supplementation increases greatly when taking Calcium supplements along with it. For best results it is recommended that Magnesium be consumed at a ratio of 1:2 with Calcium.  Health Benefits Provided by Magnesium Gluconate  Magnesium is necessary in many different bodily reactions. It also helps keep bones strong and durable, it keeps the heart going at an acceptable pace, and it also establishes the normal function of muscles and nerves.

If you remain unconvinced of magnesium’s benefits, there are many negative symptoms associated with magnesium deficiency. These include nausea, low blood pressure, confusion, muscle spasm, insomnia, slow nail growth, seizure, difficulty breathing, sleep disorders, general irritability, and restless leg syndrome.

It may also increase the effectiveness of the immune system as well as bone strength, muscle mass, and Collagen production. It keeps the blood sugar at a constant balanced level and is even necessary in energy production at a cellular level. Manganese helps to synthesize enzymes present in fatty acids and cholesterol and it is responsible for signaling the enzymes which produce DNA and RNA respectively. Manganese is needed in order to take oxygen from water, in order to stimulate certain sex hormones and in order to deal with blood clotting. Manganese is needed for the body to absorb Vitamin B1 and Vitamin E. Not only that, but Manganese works well when combined with B vitamins and increases their effectiveness as well as its own.  ;BulkSupplements;MANGGLU-100;;;0.2200;

It is often used as a diuretic because it is non-irritating and relatively inoffensive. It is sometimes used as a buffering agent in sodas and other carbonated beverages. As far as natural sources of Potassium are concerned, this mineral can be found in most types of fruit with particularly high concentrations in bananas. Potassium may also be found in vegetables, milk, and legumes. In order to make sure that the body is constantly supplied with Potassium it is necessary to consume many fruits and vegetables per day.     Health Benefits of Potassium Chloride  Potassium Chloride is a kind of salt derived from Potassium and Chlorine. It is used in the food processing industry, in medicine and various scientific uses and has the following benefits to man.  Potassium Chloride lowers blood pressure. Clinical tests have shown that Potassium Chloride supplementation reduces blood pressure both in people who have hypertension and in people who have normal blood pressure. Our body needs sufficient supply of Potassium to balance the Sodium content in the body as excess Sodium can result to high blood pressure.  Potassium Chloride helps maintain healthy heart, brain, kidneys and various muscle tissues of the body by sending electrical signals between these various tissues and the nervous system. It can also protect the heart by serving as substitute for table salt providing you the salty taste of Sodium Chloride, but not the negative effects of an elevated blood pressure.     Potassium Chloride prevents Osteoporosis by reabsorbing Calcium excreted in the urine and by maintaining Calcium balance in the body. As a person increases in age, the rate of loss of calcium in the body increases as well.   Potassium Chloride prevents Hypokalemia, a condition characterized by low levels of Potassium in the blood which manifests in the form of nerve disorders, weak muscles, muscle cramps, and heart problems.  Potassium Chloride helps relieve muscle fatigue. It is an important element in the production of proteins essential for muscle build up and repair especially after extreme physical exertion and exercise. This supplement can be useful for bodybuilders for its ability to repair tired and damaged muscle tissues of the body.   ;BulkSupplements;POTCHL-250;;;0.5510;

It is important for the body to be supplied with constantly high levels of Potassium in order to help deal with the balance of water, the acidity levels of the body, the blood pressure, and the way the muscles respond to commands from the brain. It is also able to carry on impulses throughout the heart. In order for protein and carbohydrates to be properly metabolized, Potassium is necessary.

Potassium may also be found in vegetables, milk, and legumes. In order to make sure that the body is constantly supplied with Potassium it is necessary to consume many fruits and vegetables per day. It is common to consume anywhere from 2.5 to 5.8 grams of Potassium per day in a typical diet. In general the amount of Potassium available in supplements is scaled down since taking too much at once (especially when taken in capsule form) may cause stomach problems. A standard capsule of Potassium supplement will usually have about 100mg of Potassium whereas a single banana will have about 500mg. Potassium is extremely important to the body and for those that do not consume enough per day\; supplements are there to make up for that. This particular supplement is one of the best and most popular ways to replenish Potassium. This mineral also works like an electrolyte in the sense that it is able to carry nutrients into cells and get rid of waste in cells on the way out. Electrolytes have this capability because they are able to dissolve in water allowing them to seamlessly pass through cell membranes and back out again once they have deposited what needs to be deposited. Potassium uses this power as an electrolyte to work throughout the muscular system as well, carrying messages from the heart and brain to the muscles and vice versa, so that natural bodily rhythm can be maintained and so that muscles will contract naturally.     Having low levels of Potassium causes what is called Hypokalemia. This can be caused by many things including bodily purges (whether natural or forced, including diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive urination) and is relatively common among people that are anorexic or bulimic. Any sort of condition which may cause more Potassium to leave the body than to come into it can lead to Hypokalemia and should be avoided as symptoms range from simple abdominal pains to intestinal paralysis and muscle weakness. Some types of prescription drugs, especially diuretics and other drugs which influence the urinary regularity of the body have also been known to have a negative effect on the ability of the body to absorb Potassium correctly. If you are currently on any prescription drugs you may want to have a word with a healthcare professional to find out whether it will affect this supplement. Other factors which may affect Potassium absorption include the consumption of laxatives or alcohol, as alcohol has a diuretic effect and anything which may flush out the system does not leave enough time for supplements to be absorbed adequately. Thus, those who may be classified as alcoholics or those that are taking laxatives or diuretics for other reasons may eventually find it necessary to supplement potassium.  ;BulkSupplements;POTCIT-250;;;0.5510;

Any sort of condition which may cause more Potassium to leave the body than to come into it can lead to Hypokalemia and should be avoided as symptoms range from simple abdominal pains to intestinal paralysis and muscle weakness. Some types of prescription drugs, especially diuretics and other drugs which influence the urinary regularity of the body have also been known to have a negative effect on the ability of the body to absorb Potassium correctly. If you are currently on any prescription drugs you may want to have a word with a healthcare professional to find out whether it will affect this supplement. Other factors which may affect Potassium absorption include the consumption of laxatives or alcohol, as alcohol has a diuretic effect and anything which may flush out the system does not leave enough time for supplements to be absorbed adequately. Thus, those who may be classified as alcoholics or those that are taking laxatives or diuretics for other reasons may eventually find it necessary to supplement potassium.  ;BulkSupplements;POTCIT-5KG;;;11.0231;

It is important for the body to be supplied with constantly high levels of Potassium in order to help deal with the balance of water, the acidity levels of the body, the blood pressure, and the way the muscles respond to commands from the brain. It is also able to carry on impulses throughout the heart. In order for protein and carbohydrates to be properly metabolized, Potassium is necessary. When Potassium Citrate is excreted it comes out in the form of a carbonate. It is often used as a diuretic because it is non-irritating and relatively inoffensive. It is sometimes used as a buffering agent in sodas and other carbonated beverages.   Health Benefits Provided by Potassium Citrate  As far as natural sources of Potassium are concerned, this mineral can be found in most types of fruit with particularly high concentrations in bananas. Potassium may also be found in vegetables, milk, and legumes. In order to make sure that the body is constantly supplied with Potassium it is necessary to consume many fruits and vegetables per day. It is common to consume anywhere from 2.5 to 5.8 grams of Potassium per day in a typical diet. In general the amount of Potassium available in supplements is scaled down since taking too much at once (especially when taken in capsule form) may cause stomach problems. A standard capsule of Potassium supplement will usually have about 100mg of Potassium whereas a single banana will have about 500mg. Potassium is extremely important to the body and for those that do not consume enough per day\; supplements are there to make up for that. This particular supplement is one of the best and most popular ways to replenish Potassium. This mineral also works like an electrolyte in the sense that it is able to carry nutrients into cells and get rid of waste in cells on the way out. Electrolytes have this capability because they are able to dissolve in water allowing them to seamlessly pass through cell membranes and back out again once they have deposited what needs to be deposited. Potassium uses this power as an electrolyte to work throughout the muscular system as well, carrying messages from the heart and brain to the muscles and vice versa, so that natural bodily rhythm can be maintained and so that muscles will contract naturally.     Having low levels of Potassium causes what is called Hypokalemia. This can be caused by many things including bodily purges (whether natural or forced, including diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive urination) and is relatively common among people that are anorexic or bulimic. Any sort of condition which may cause more Potassium to leave the body than to come into it can lead to Hypokalemia and should be avoided as symptoms range from simple abdominal pains to intestinal paralysis and muscle weakness.

Hypokalemia is rarely caused by a Potassium-deficient diet but is usually caused by severe diarrhea, vomiting and increased urination. A Hypokalemia patient show signs of this disorder in the form of arrhythmia, slow muscle reflexes, problems in bowel movement, muscle weakness and abnormal electrical activities of the heart. Another important benefit of Potassium Gluconate is its ability to balance the body's acid-base content to maintain the body's normal metabolism and physiological functions. Potassium produces alkaline salts which are products of a weak base and a strong acid combination preventing an extremely acidic body environment.  Potassium Gluconate acts as the body's natural diuretic. Diuretics are substances that stimulate the production of urine and promotes the removal of excess water content from the body. Potassium Gluconate as a diuretic is therefore important in the treatment of kidney diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension and other heart ailments due to its cleansing effect to the body.  Potassium Gluconate, together with other major electrolytes ensures a balance of electrolyte content inside and outside of body cells.  Potassium Gluconate also called Potassium D-Gluconate, is important in ensuring normal heart beat, converting our food intake to energy that we can use daily, promoting growth of muscle cells and properly balancing the body's water content.;BulkSupplements;PG-250;;;0.5510;

BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Calcium & Minerals;Potassium L-Aspartate - 5kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/potassium-l-aspartate.html;POTASP-5KG;184.89;;men, women;;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_6_306.jpg;Aspartate is a kind of acidic amino acid which is the salt or ester of Aspartic Acid. Aspartic acid becomes Aspartate when an acid and a base become neutralized with equal numbers of cations and anions producing a chemical compound that is neutrally charged.  Aspartate is an important component of the essential amino acids Isoleucine, Methionine, Lysine and Threonine found in plants and other microorganisms as it converts to these amino acids in its semi-aldehyde state.   Aspartic Acid was obtained from Asparagine, another amino acid which has been extracted from asparagus juice.   Potassium on the other hand is a chemical element important for the proper functioning of the brain and nerves\; it exerts its influence in maintaining fluid balance between the interstitial fluid and the cells in the body.  Potassium prevents Hypokalemia, a condition caused by severe vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive urination, by replenishing lost electrolytes in the body.     HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY POTASSIUM L-ASPARTATE Potassium L aspartate protects against high blood pressure. Studies and continuous research show that a diet deficient in potassium can result to hypertension thus a regular and generous intake of potassium-rich foods can control hypertension especially in individulas who are constantly on a high-sodium diet.  Potassium L aspartate protects against osteoporosis and kidney stone build up by preventing excessive excretion of calcium in the urine. It delays the onset of osteoporosis by preventing demineralization of bones which is an inevitable part of the aging process.   Potassium L aspartate protects against dehydration by restoring the body's electrolyte balance.

BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids;Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) - 5kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/acetyl-l-carnitine-alcar.html;ALCAR-5KG;217.34;;men, women;849720000149;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_161.jpg;Being more effective than regular L-Carnitine in that very little dilution of the original concentration occurs when it is administered directly to systemic circulation, it is a bit more on the expensive side given that manufacturing costs are much higher. Due to the association that ALCAR has with the specific acetyl group that it belongs to, it is known for the great variety of benefits it provides to general brain functions and mental health. In fact, Alpha Lipoic Acid, another type of acid found within the body that works in tandem with ALCAR has recently been discovered to have immense benefits when broken down in conjunction with the aforementioned ALCAR. Once again, because of its level of concentration, it is much easier for the system to absorb ALCAR than its base relative, L-Carnitine. It is this very attribute of ALCAR that makes it such an effective type of antioxidant.  BENEFITS PROVIDED BY Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)  Once again, one of the major health benefits associated with Acetyl-L-Carnitine is its efficiency in breaking down fatty acids and turning them into a useable energy source to fuel the body. In this sense it helps regulate human metabolism at a basic cellular level. Even though the body regularly produces acceptable amounts of ALCAR all by itself, taking additional supplements can still greatly speed up the speed of this cellular metabolism process, thereby resulting in more energy conserved, less energy wasted. During this process of energy production, Carnitines are also known for being able to assist in the removal of waste products from the system\; another reason that these are produced by the liver, an organ which is known for acting as a kind of filter. Generally the body of a healthy person will relegate the kidneys towards managing healthy levels of Carnitines, but bodies afflicted with any sort of kidney disease and in some cases other types of cardiovascular illnesses will result in significantly reduced levels of Carnitines.  ACETYL-L-CARNITINE AND ALPHA LIPOIC ACID  When these two acids are combined, the result is a synergistic effect which allows the mental power and generally everyday brain functions of a person to become much more focused and enhanced. Each of these compounds has properties which assist the brain on their own, but when combined the effect is magnified to even greater proportions. It is because of this that the two are generally found blended together in the various products. Alpha Lipoic Acid is another enzyme which is naturally occurring on its own because it is so important in the process of cellular metabolism. Its usefulness when blended with ALCAR becomes clear in a few different ways. For one, it is able to greatly speed up the transportation of Glucose to muscle tissue resulting in a greater sense of both speed and endurance in the body. Secondly, it allows a greater breadth of fatty acid content to actually be consumed during the metabolizing process so that less weight is gained and more energy is provided to the body. While the powder itself may be a bit off-putting to the taste, here these supplements can be found in proportional amounts contained within capsules so that the slight burning sensation that occurs when the substances hit the tongue need not be endured.;BulkSupplements;ALCAR-5KG;;;13.0073;

It also helps in maintaining good levels of blood sugar, hormones, and keeps the immune system functioning well. Arginine is one of the rare amino acids that is considered semi-essential because though the body can manufacture perfectly appropriate amounts of the acid to keep up to normal amounts, every once in a while it may be necessary to supplement it. Arginine is able to support the immune system through its ability to produce T-cells, and it is also supportive of the liver in that it is able to rid the body of toxins. Urea is needed in order for the body to expel Ammonia through the urine however\; urea would not be manufactured without Arginine. Arginine is also helpful in releasing insulin when necessary and in creating and facilitating the creation of important hormones. Arginine helps to stop the restriction of blood flow throughout the body. It allows blood vessels to relax rather than be constricted, dilating them so that there is better flow of oxygen throughout the body.   Health Benefits Provided by L-Arginine HCL  There are many different foods which contain L-Arginine including soy products, barley, almonds and other nuts, raisins, types of cereal, meats, oats, and wheat products including flour. These are all major sources of Arginine.  There are some conditions which cause people to not be able to accumulate or produce enough Arginine. If you happen to have one such condition, Arginine supplementation is the best alternative for you. Also, those who are interested in maintaining strict levels of exercise should keep up their levels of Arginine. Arginine can be found in high concentrations in the skin. Muscles and connective tissues are also supported by the presence of Arginine in the blood. Creatine and nitrogen supplements are generally taken by body builders and exercise enthusiasts because of their ability to create energy and enhance muscle mass respectively. However, the strength and effectiveness of these supplements is determined by Arginine\; because without this amino acid, it would be impossible for the body to process these other elements, making Arginine just as important for exercise as either of the other two.;BulkSupplements;L-ARGHCL-5KG;;;11.0200;

;Whey Protein Isolate 90% - 1kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/whey-protein-isolate-90.html;WPISO-1kg;26.99;;men, women;849720009203;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_61.jpg;Whey Protein Isolate is the purest form of Whey Protein where the water, fats and lactose content have been removed. It contains a larger amount of pure protein than Whey Protein Concentrate and Whey Protein Hydrolysate.   It is a rich source of branched chain amino acids, essential amino acids which are largely found in muscle tissues and used primarily in the production of proteins and in enhancing physical performance. Leucine is the branched chain amino acid that is primarily responsible for initiating protein synthesis in the body.   The difference among these three forms of Whey Protein lies in their manner of filtration. Microfiltration and the ion exchangers method have been used in the production of Whey Protein Isolate.   Whey Protein Isolate contains a large amount of protein which can be further filtrated to yield a Whey Protein Isolate that is completely free of cholesterol, lactose, carbohydrates and fats.   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY WHEY PROTEIN POWDER ISOLATE 90% - CLEAN Whey Protein Isolate is a very rich source of protein, which accounts for 90 percent of its total weight. It builds muscle tissues and repair damaged ones, helps in the recovery of tired and exhausted muscles after high intensity physical exercise.  Whey Protein can help prevent the body's accumulation of fats. Consuming Whey Protein Isolate in its pure form where a large percentage of fats have been removed can help you maintain a lean body.   Whey Protein Isolate is good for people suffering from lactose intolerance. Unlike Whey Protein Concentrate and Whey Protein Hydrolysate, Whey Protein Isolate contains a very small amount of lactose or none at all, as this has been removed together with fats thus making it safe for people who cannot tolerate lactose.  ;BulkSupplements;WPISO-1kg;;;2.2050;

Also known as E330, it is one of the main ingredients in the food and beverage industry because it is easily obtained in large quantities, healthy and cheap. It is often used for proper mineral supplementation of food, as an acidity regulator, and as a flavor compound. Citric Acid enhances the activity of many beneficial antioxidants, but is not, itself, an antioxidant.  Citric Acid is used for its health benefits as well as in food, alcohol and insecticide production. It is the most frequently used preservative in the world today. The lemon salt has been used for centuries to conserve meat and fish. It increases the acidity of the bacterial environment, making it difficult for it and the microbes to survive and, most importantly, to reproduce. It is called lemon salt because it was first extracted from a lemon. It looks like a semi-transparent salt and it has no odor. It has a sour, acid taste.   ;BulkSupplements;CRA-1KG;;;2.2050;

Although the traditional sedatives still assert their efficacy in relieving stress and anxiety and panic, they make the cosmonauts drowsy which are not acceptable to them as they need to stay awake while traveling in space. Phenibut became their drug of choice and was in fact made part of the cosmonaut's kit in one of their space missions.  Phenibut is obtained from Gamma Amino Butyric Acid or GABA, a major neurotransmitter in the body. The only difference these two chemical compounds have is Phenibut contains a phenyl ring that has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier easily penetrating the brain in a matter of minutes.  Phenibut, whose name comes from ß-Phenyl-?-aminobutyric acid, also has the ability to relieve insomnia symptoms and to reduce stress.    HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY PHENIBUT Phenibut relieves anxiety and panic. The calming and tranquilizing effect of Phenibut has been lauded and acclaimed by users in their favorable reviews in online forums. These properties and its added attribute of preventing drowsiness made it the drug of choice of cosmonauts in a space mission launched by Russia in the 60's.  Phenibut enhances the effects of sleeping pills, sedatives and narcotics. Phenibut has the ability to potentiate or make these drugs more potent and effective to users.   ;BulkSupplements;PNBT-100;;;0.2200;

It also asserts it antibiotic properties by inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the Eustachian tube, a part of the ear that connects the nose and the ear. This is attributed to Xylitol's ability to form into different structures that prevent bacteria from growing and thriving in the ears.  Xylitol is also recommended for people with diabetes. It has a lower caloric content than table sugar, it is easily absorbed in the body and does not cause blood sugar level to rise that would further result to hyperglycemia.  Xylitol is used in the manufacture of nutraceuticals and women's hygienic products.   It is naturally present in fruit and vegetable fibers and can be extracted from various fibrous food and other materials.   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY XYLITOL Xylitol protects against tooth enamel damage and promotes its re-mineralization. Its ability to stop the growth of bacteria responsible for causing the deterioration of tooth enamel makes it a perfect ingredient for chewing gums, certain syrups and lozenges. It has the ability to remineralize or restore tooth enamel resulting to stronger and healthier teeth.  Xylitol protects against Otitis Media. Xylitol's antibacterial properties prevent the proliferation of the Pneumococcus bacteria responsible for causing Pneumonia and other diseases, which include Otitis Media. Xylitol chewing gum is recommended to prevent Otitis Media due to the chewing and swallowing action of Xylitol which can remove wax and dirt from the ears. Xylitol has the ability to clean the middle ears by unclogging them of wax and dirt that have accumulated in that part of the inner ear.  Xylitol does not raise the body's blood sugar level. It is a sweetener that is as sweet as table sugar but has fewer calories and does not increase the sugar content in the blood to further aggravate hyperglycemia. It is the type of sweetener that does not contribute to weight gain thus recommended for people who are on a weight loss program.  ;BulkSupplements;XY-25KG;;;55.1160;

The little that is absorbed is excreted in the urine, and doesn’t accumulate in the body. Sucralose is available in tabletop sweeteners and also as an ingredient in many products, including a variety of beverages, baked goods, desserts, dairy products, canned fruits, syrups and condiments. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar, and it can be used in place of or combined with sugar in cooking and baking. Sucralose has been studied extensively and has been found to be safe by experts and researchers around the world. Government agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have also reviewed the science on Sucralose and found it to be safe for human consumption.  As a no-calorie alternative to sugar, Sucralose-containing foods and beverages still allow people who are following a weight loss or weight management program to enjoy sweet, good tasting options.  For example, a light yogurt containing Sucralose can save 50 or more calories per serving compared to regular yogurt, and a 12-ounce glass of iced tea sweetened with Sucralose can save more than 100 calories compared to the same glass of tea sweetened with sugar.   ;BulkSupplements;SRL-25KG;;;55.1156;
;D-Ribose Powder-25kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/d-ribose.html;RIB-25KG;489.88;;men, women;849720011190;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_205.jpg;A healthy cell will constantly be in the process of restocking ATP after its used in order to always have back-up energy. However, under conditions which might be described as particularly stressful, the most important organs in the body such as skeletal tissues, the heart, and other essential body parts, might not be able to replace used ATP fast enough to reach optimum performance. Taking D-Ribose supplements can have the effect of speeding up this replacement process in order to protect the heart and other organs from failing during times of stress. Also, D-Ribose and a compound related to it called Deoxyribose, which are also components necessary in the formation of DNA and RNA, respectively.  Due to its effects at helping energy levels increase and its efficiency in jump starting energy storage, D-Ribose is also thought to possibly help in lowering recovery time after an intense workout, making the next one ever easier to complete. Also, no matter what age, gender, or level of physical activity you are at, D-Ribose can have beneficial effects.   Health Benefits Provided By D-Ribose  Ribose is instrumental in the synthesis of ATP which in turn goes on to help the body produce energy, making D-Ribose an important aspect in the body’s process of energy production. D-Ribose can also assist in increasing stamina and decreasing recovery time, making it useful for athletes. D-Ribose, when taken with Creatine, can have an even more intense and pronounced effect not only on giving new energy to the body, but also in increasing the length of a workout routine through its effects on endurance. The supplements that D-Ribose and Creatine come in are generally marketed towards the body building community. ;BulkSupplements;RIB-25KG;;;57.1125;

There is no scientific evidence that drinking coffee could slow down the growth of children and adolescents.   Green Coffee Bean is not considered a risk factor in pregnancy . The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has declared that this product is safe for pregnant women with a safe consumption of up to 200mg/day.  Green Coffee Bean is not safe for dogs and birds because these animals do not have the capacity to metabolize the product to a level which is safe for their consumption.  Green Coffee Bean acts as a natural pesticide, keeping away pests and insects that could harm coffee, tea and kola nut plants. The natural stimulant found in this product is obtained from coffee beans, tea leaves, and drinks that are processed from kola nuts. Guarana berries, Guayusa, Yerba Mate and the Yaupon Holly are also known sources.   BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CAFFEINE NATURAL COFFEE BEAN  Recent studies have shown that Caffeine reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is believed to prevent the deterioration of brain cells associated with intelligence and therefore can be used to prevent Alzheimer's disease.    Caffeine is also believed to provide energy to the muscles making it potentially useful in treating Parkinson's disease.   Caffeine provides energy and alleviates fatigue.  Caffeine acts as antioxidant by protecting the body against the harmful effects of free radicals.  Studies reveal that those who have consumed large amounts of Caffeine in their lifetime derive the most benefits from Caffeine. ;BulkSupplements;GRNCOFF-25KG;;;57.4225;
;Chlorella Blue-Green Algae Powder-10kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/chlorella-blue-green-algae.html;CHLOR-10kg;508.26;;men, women;849720013743;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_1_368.jpg;While this type of algae grows naturally in all kinds of fresh water sources, the kind that is used by humans is cultivated in large pools and is exposed to large amounts of direct sunlight, clean water, and fresh air so as to make it as healthy and beneficial as possible. Special equipment is required to harvest these algae due to their small size. This plant reproduces once every twenty hours allowing it to spread rapidly. This algae is believed to be about 2 billion years old, and was one of the first plants to have anything that could be called a defined nucleus in its cellular structure. Despite how prevalent it is, it was not actually discovered until the 19th century. It was late in the 1800’s when it was discovered by the Dutch. After its discovery, it was researched for possible use as a source of protein. Though it was regarded as a possible food source and had sufficient nutritional properties, cultivating it in order to feed the masses after the food shortage and population boom, which took place shortly after the end of WWII, was determined to be uneconomic overall. Though these pursuits were abandoned, it was still cultivated for other specific uses, and more research resulted in more uses being discovered for this algae. Chlorella are small enough to be considered microorganisms, and each individual microorganism contains the basic structure of a cell, including a nucleus, mitochondria, cell walls made up of cellulose for protection and to hold these components together along with starch grains and chloroplasts which are present in the cellular structure of most plants.  Why is Chlorella Algae Powder Popular Today?  Popularity of Chlorella Algae still endures despite how old and difficult to cultivate it is. Why is this? This has to do with the adaptive history of Chlorella Algae. Because it is a freshwater plant, it had to adapt to survive periodic droughts that were very much a reality in the erratic weather patterns of the past 2 billion years. Therefore, it developed a fibrous shell around it which had two different important characteristics. It first allowed the cellular structure of the algae to be maintained as long as possible until the algae had been dried out beyond all hope. Secondly, and most importantly, this shell was used to absorb nutrients in the surrounding water to keep feeding the cell for as long as possible. This happened until the water was totally gone so that when the water returns, it is able to easily bounce back to full recovery. It is this property that makes Chlorella Algae so useful to humans. This particular powder is called 'Chlorella Algae Broken Cell' because the outer shell has been cracked. This allows the nutrients within the algae to be more effectively absorbed while still providing the same benefits of the outer shell to the human body and digestive tract.  Health Benefits Provided By Chlorella Blue-Green Algae  One of the most prominent health benefits of Chlorella Algae lies in its ability to detoxify the digestive tract. The outer shell of the Chlorella absorbs all of the toxic agents that are present in the digestive tract and detoxifies the intestines as it passes through. Not only that, but the insides of the algae are chock full of nutrients including Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Folic acid, Vitamin B2, Manganese, and Iodine. Chlorella Algae helps to open up the arteries, increasing blood flow, and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen that makes it to muscle tissue and all of the important areas. It also synthesizes red blood cells to stimulate creation of new blood and the production of microscopic plant cultures within the intestine. These will continue to produce similar effects to Chlorella Algae without having to take the supplement all the time. The question about the difference between Chlorella Algae and Spirulina Algae is often brought up since the two are very similar. The biggest difference is that Chlorella Algae have higher Iron content than Spirulina which can be a benefit or a drawback depending on the individual needs of the person taking it. Pregnant women often need to have higher Iron intake to make up for the amount being taken by their child. Older men also need more Iron in their diet to strengthen their bones. However, taking too much Iron can cause oxidation which puts greater pressure on the immune system to neutralize free radicals. It’s all about personal preference and what’s best for the person in question ;BulkSupplements;CHLOR-10kg;;;22.0462;
;BCAA 3:1:2 (Branch Chain Amino Acids) Powder-25kg Pure Powder;http://www.bulksupplements.com/branch-chain-amino-acids-bcaa-3648.html;BCAA312-25KG;390.38;;men, women;849720013866;http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_36.jpg;There three different amino acids are totally essential to sustaining human life. A human being will not be able to survive if these amino acids are not produced and consumed regularly. They are referred to as branch chain amino acids because they have a chemical structure which separates them from the rest of the amino acid family that are also considered essential. In addition, these BCAA's make up 40% of total body protein content and represent around 15 to 25 percent of total protein intake overall. Leucine is the product of protein hydrolysis by way of various enzymes present in the pancreas. This reaction is part of the overall digestive process and is absolutely necessary in maintaining healthy growth levels in children and infants, as well as keeping regulated nitrogen levels in human adults. Valine is essential in maintaining the structure of various proteins that it has been incorporated into. Isoleucine is again, a chemical used to help stimulate the production and circulation of energy throughout the body. Each of these different amino acids is taken directly into the muscle during the metabolic process which makes them great candidates for muscle building for athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone else that might be routinely involved in strenuous physical activity. BCAAs are found in their greatest natural quantities in products such as red meat and many types of dairy. Protein supplements synthesized from an egg base or from whey are ideal for finding high amounts of BCAA's. Isoleucine alone is found in just about every type of food, but particularly high amounts are usually seen in all types of meats including fish, and various cheeses. Leucine is found in more complex and refined sources of sustenance such as corn, yeast, brown rice, etc. Valine is usually found in flour, soy, mushrooms, peanuts, and meats.   HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS  As mentioned before, Branch Chain Amino Acids are used as supplements among a large community of athletes and body builder types because of their properties which help improve rates of muscle re-growth and increase general energy production. This means that once the workout is over there are less negative effects afterwards such as excessive tiredness and painful joints and muscles. These BCAAs are particularly important for muscles which are attached to the skeletal structure since they act as their primary source of fuel when they are taxed by long exercise sessions. BCAAs, because of their relation and necessity to exercise are needed in higher quantities than any of the body’s other essential amino acids. They help in the building of muscle because they decrease the speed at which proteins break down while at the same time promoting their synthesis. They enter the body, and after going through the metabolic process, are turned into muscle tissue. Another way in which isoleucine is important to the body is because of its capacity to help maintain blood sugar levels along with energy levels, and in helping the healing process of bones, skin, and muscle tissue all over the body. Any healthy diet must take Isoleucine into account as it is one of the essential amino acids that is not naturally produced within the body. Leucine is essential because this BCAA is what keeps protein synthesis going on at a normal pace. Valine also helps in synthesis of Glucose, a process which takes place in the liver and is useful during any time in which anaerobic activity is taking place. BCAAs may reach the pinnacle of importance as far as the life of an athlete is concerned, but they are often sought out by those that desire to maintain generally good health because of their multiple uses and healthy properties. These amino acids are metabolized, not in the liver as with most other amino acids, but in the muscle tissue, making them take instant effect during strenuous exercise, which increases their popularity among athletes. Even the smallest amount of exercise can lower levels of BCAAs, leading to feelings of exhaustion over a short time. For anyone interested in maintaining a comprehensive exercise regimen over a long period of time, BCAAs represent a great supplement to maintain this level of activity while minimizing the side effects caused by exhaustion.;BulkSupplements;BCAA312-25KG;;;57.1140;

This takes place during exercise which creates a high demand for energy, triggering this process. Once this occurs, the newly created ATP drives muscle contraction and then goes on to produce even more protein. Since this reaction is reversible, this also allows the Adenosine Diphosphate (the original form of Adenosine Triphosphate before Creatine donates an ion to it) to create more Creatine in the form of Phosphocreatine, a type of Creatine which can be stored in the muscles for later use.  HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CREATINE HCL  Creatine HCL has been shown to help increase overall muscle mass as well as strength, as long as it is taken in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise. It also extends the time of the average workout by giving the body more energy to work out with.;BulkSupplements;CREAHCL25KG;;;57.5000;

It is non hygroscopic, which means it does not pick up moisture. Its pleasant taste, stability to moisture pickup and ability to not discolour when heated makes mannitol powder ideal for use in pharmaceuticals and nutritional tablets. HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY MANNITOL   Mannitol can help you manage conditions such as diabetes since it does not affect blood sugar levels, and can be used as a sugar alternative and low calorie sweetener in many circumstances. Due Mannitol being 1/2 as sweet as sugar people who have adjusted their taste to less sweet tasting palate can still enjoy desserts and treats made with mannitol powder without them tasting too sickly. Using mannitol as a sweetener can help minimise caloric intake, which in turn leads to being able tomanage and control weight on a more sustainable basis. Mannitol is used to give foods a sweet taste without increasing the calories. This means Mannitol Powder can increase weight loss as part of a calorie controlled diet.  ;BulkSupplements;MANN-25kg;;;57.5000;

This bacterium causes about 90% of urine infections, as well as Cystitis. The bacterium attaches itself to the bladder wall, hence causing urinary infections. The use of D-Mannose powder attracts the E-coli bug which removes it from the bladder wall. The bug is then effectively expelled when you urinate, leaving the bladder clear of any infection.  Many people prefer D-Mannose as an alternative to antibiotics as it does not randomly kill all bacteria, but will flush out the E-coli bug during urination. Regular drugs tend to eliminate not only harmful bacteria, but good bacteria on the gastrointestinal tract as well. This eliminates good bacteria that are required to maintain optimal health. As a result of this confusion, your body could be under attack by antibiotic resistant bacteria in the future.    ;BulkSupplements;D-MNS-25KG;;;57.5000;

The fiber works by absorbing water in the gut, ensuring that bowel movements pass easily. While supplementation for temporary issues is perfectly fine, many individuals frequently take Psyllium Husk in order to maintain their overall digestive health. Though unconfirmed, the liquid absorption and sense of fullness that Psyllium Husk often promotes might lead to weight loss as well. Coupled with a low-fat diet, Psyllium Husk has also been shown to lower overall cholesterol. This is particularly important for individuals over 50, as the body’s ability to regulate levels decreases with age. Research has suggested that as a direct result of lowered cholesterol, Psyllium Husk may also assist in strengthening the heart and lowering blood pressure. ;BulkSupplements;PSYLHU25K;;;58.4225;

The body would not be able to make proper use of the benefits of glucose without Glycine. Glucose can also be found in high concentrations throughout the spinal cord because it inhibits certain neurotransmitters.  Not only does it inhibit some neurotransmitters, it also helps others which are responsible for cognition and memory in the brain. Glycine may also block the passage of certain toxins attempting to enter the system, rendering them less harmful before they reach their destination.  In its ability to make energy out of glucose, Glycine also assists in the synthesis of stomach bile. This process helps the digestive system dissolve foods into usable nutrients and break down fats. For this reason, Glycine can be found in many antacids.   Glycine can be made directly from the synthesis of choline that takes place in the kidneys and liver. It also has the ability to be derived from another amino acid called serine, but can be transformed back into serine under the right conditions. ;BulkSupplements;L-GLY20KG;;;44.0925;

Glutathione helps in protecting cellular structure, preserving the effectiveness of the immune system and detoxifying the liver. ALA is the only antioxidant that is known to increase its production levels. The Krebs cycle is the body’s process for turning sugars and carbohydrates into usable energy, and ALA is also instrumental in facilitating this process. ALA can neutralize various free radicals that can cause damage to other cells while they circulate throughout the body. This can often speed up muscle recovery and metabolism for athletes. ALA is also known for helping in the regulation of cholesterol levels, which in turn contributes to an overall feeling of well-being.  ;BulkSupplements;ALA25kg;;;57.4225;

Bitartrate, also known as Tartaric Acid, is combined with Choline in this compound, which helps to increase the overall rate of absorption into the body. This compound is also indirectly responsible for helping to maintain cellular structure and integrity in the synthesis of compounds. The human body is capable of producing limited amounts of Choline naturally on its own, but these are often not enough to constitute full servings. Choline is a nutrient necessary to keep up the emulsification of fats and cholesterol, facilitating the movement of hormones to the correct areas of the body. It also helps maintain the nervous system and gallbladder. Although it is not actually a B vitamin, it is sometimes considered to be a part of this complex because it operates in conjunction with various types of B vitamins. The compound is indirectly involved in the conversion of fat into energy and nutrients, speeding up their mobilization throughout the body. It also aids in the production of HDL, a helpful type of cholesterol. Choline also assists in the formation of Betaine. Choline is especially important in establishing endurance when it comes to physical exercise. Choline becomes depleted very quickly in athletes that participate in taxing exercise regimens. This in turn means that less Acetylcholine can be synthesized, which could result in permanent damage to the liver or to muscles. It is also useful in a variety of other ways too, such as cell communications, stabilizing the correct functions of muscles, regulation of impulse transmission through the nervous system, and in the production of Acetylcholine, which is known to influence state of mind, eating habits and general behavior. Finally, Choline can also act as an antioxidant to some extent, protecting healthy cells from harmful free radicals. ;BulkSupplements;LCHOL25KG;;;57.4225;

As a bonus, Spirulina acts as a great source of Vitamin B12, essential fatty acids, Beta Carotene, and Chlorophyll. Some of these elements are only present in high amounts in the diets of meat eaters, and other nutrients like Beta-Carotene and Chlorophyll act as antioxidants and are useful in helping the body get rid of toxins.  Spirulina has such positive nutritional content that it is called the world’s richest natural whole food. It is sometimes called “green food” as well due to the fact that it has such an enormous amount of healthy minerals in it and low-calorie content. It is also a good source of Protein for vegetarians.   Due to the large amount of Iron in Spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does Spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body’s ability to absorb protein. Spirulina contains a concentration of every essential amino acid as well. While the body cannot survive without these, they cannot be produced naturally and must be supplemented in the diet. ;BulkSupplements;SPIORG25KG;;;57.4225;

These each have strong antioxidant properties that help fight harmful free radicals that go throughout the body hurting healthy cells. These molecules can be found in the body naturally from exposure to various toxins like pollution, food and cigarette smoke. Without antioxidants, they are hard to get rid of. These free radicals have the potential to alter DNA and kill cells, which makes them responsible for a whole host of other health problems. The important point is that antioxidants can stop them.  This extract is believed to assist with mood, memory loss, headaches and other issues associated with reduced blood flow to the brain and body.

Those that have below-average levels of Zinc will experience negative symptoms such as poor night vision, slower healing after sustaining wounds, a reduction in the senses of both smell and taste and a lack of development in the reproductive organs (if the person is younger or still developing).   Reduction of Zinc levels in children can stunt growth, cause greater receptiveness to infection and disease. There are around 800,000 deaths per year reported where Zinc deficiency was either a direct or indirect cause. In fact, Zinc deficiency is credited with being the fifth-highest risk factor in disease development. A quarter of the world’s population may be at risk of developing a Zinc deficiency.   Zinc itself is an antioxidant and can protect healthy cells in the body from sustaining damage due to free radicals. Zinc is also an important component in many different enzymatic reactions that contribute to the regularity of the body’s development. Specifically, collagen and Vitamin A are both dependent upon Zinc for their metabolism. Zinc also affects the ability to taste and smell, the appetite, and the levels of Vitamin E found in the blood. Zinc is commonly used to protect the skin and as an antiseptic.;BulkSupplements;ZINCIT25KG;;;57.4225;

It is also necessary in stimulating the adrenal gland at certain points in order to increase hormone production and synthesize certain hormones. It can speed up general chemical reactions controlled by enzymes at a cellular level.   The body is often in great need of Niacin, and being able to provide ideal levels can be difficult without correct dietary scheduling. Niacin also blocks fats from making their way into the blood stream to some extent. In addition, taking Niacin at about 20mg per day or more has been shown in many scientific tests to increase overall metabolism. However, taking too much Niacin over time can cause a slowdown or stoppage of the body’s breakdown of fats.  Niacin is an excellent supplement for vegetarians, vegans and people who frequently consume alcohol. This is because diets that are low on meat are also low on Niacin, since some of the largest stores come from tryptophan. Niacin deficiency is actually quite prevalent among Americans, with symptoms including dementia, canker sores, gastrointestinal problems, low blood sugar, muscle tension and pains, inflammation of the skin, insomnia, fatigue, digestion problems and a whole host of other problems. Pellagra is a fatal disease which is often associated with extreme Niacin deficiency in the diet. This can result in debilitating mental issues, skin problems and additional gastrointestinal symptoms if left untreated. The best way to prevent this from occurring is to keep up Niacin levels in the body. ;BulkSupplements;NIA-20KG;;;57.4225;

Also known as E330, Citric Acid is a normal component of human cells that is metabolized, degraded and eliminated from the body. It is one of the main ingredients in the food and beverage industry because it is easily obtained in large quantities, healthy and cheap. It is often used for proper mineral supplementation of food, as an acidity regulator and as a flavor compound. Citric Acid enhances the activity of many beneficial antioxidants, but is not, itself, an antioxidant.  This product is also used for its health benefits in food, alcohol and insecticide production as well. It is the most frequently used preservative in the world today. The lemon salt has been used for centuries to conserve meat and fish. It increases the acidity of the bacterial environment, making it difficult for it and the microbes to survive and, most importantly, to reproduce. It is called lemon salt because it was first extracted from a lemon.  ;BulkSupplements;CRA-50LBS;;;49.8250;

Fish Oil also helps maintain generally high levels of strong cardiovascular health.  This supplement is extracted from the tissues of fish with exceptionally oily bodily content such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, halibut, cod liver and herring. These fish develop this oil in their bodies when they eat micro-algae, which helps in the synthesis of these acids.  There are Omega-3 fatty acids present in other sources too, such as Flaxseed oil and Soybean oil, but these come in the form of Alpha-Linolenic Acid. These oils must go through a conversion process in order to reach the state of DHA and EPA\; this process causes most of the benefits brought on by these two fatty acids to be lost in interim, bringing limited benefit. Not only that, but as we age, the body becomes less capable of performing this conversion process. This is why Fish Oil is a much better source of Omega-3 fatty acids.

Due to the importance of Folic Acid, the FDA actually requires foods such as bread, corn meal, rice, pasta, noodles and other grainy foods to be fortified with certain concentrations of Folic Acid. When Folic Acid is being consumed, it is best taken in tandem with Vitamin B12 or Vitamin C in order to facilitate more effective break down and creation of new proteins for later use. Taking Folic Acid before and during pregnancy is highly recommended and very important to having a healthy child. Not only do doctors prescribe Folic Acid supplements routinely for pregnant women, but they also recommend eating foods high in Folic Acid content. Anyone that is deficient in Folic Acid will eventually experience health problems as a result. ;BulkSupplements;FOLIC25KG;;;57.4225;
