100	Vitamin E 1300 IU Oil	http://www.bulksupplements.com/vitamin-e-oil-1300-iu.html	82.19	In fact, the Vitamin E which is found naturally comes in not 1, but 8 different forms which each have their own importance in the body's biological processes. Since of the 8 forms of Vitamin E half are Tocopherols and the other half are Tocotrienols, this product contains large quantities of alpha, delta, and gamma Tocopherols and a few beta.Alpha-Tocopherol is the most effective of these forms in terms of its tendency and ability to be absorbed by the body. It is located throughout the human blood stream and is known for being both the most active type of Vitamin E in the body and also the only naturally occurring kind of Alpha-Tocopherol. There is some research which remarks on the possibility for the effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol to be increased when in the presence of other tocopherols; however this research has yet to be proven for certain. As far as the comparison between natural and synthetic forms of Tocopherols, the competition isn't even close. Natural Tocopherol beats out synthetic Vitamin E in terms of retention as well as absorption every time.Vitamin E can be found in many different skin creams because it is known for promoting skin health and elasticity. It can even increase the healing rate when a burn or cut has been sustained if it is applied in a timely manner. Vitamin E does not only protect the skin on the outside though, it also protects it at a deeper cellular level by keeping cell membranes well protected and giving them a defense against oxidation.Vitamin E is absorbed into the blood via the lymph, which in turn takes it from the stomach just as is the case with bile and fats. Once it is in the blood, it can be transferred to the liver to be stored for later use. There the Tocopherols can use the liver as a base to send out agents to prevent free radicals from harming the body. As it is found in various supplements, Vitamin E is actually just Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate which above all, allows it to continue its antioxidant functions despite how it is absorbed and digested.Vitamin E is a relatively common dietary supplement and is sold as such. It can even be derived naturally from a few different foods. Sometimes it is even present in foods as an additive. It is often prized particularly for its effectiveness as an antioxidant.Free radicals are merely molecules with unshared electrons. These electrons are known for retaining a high level of energy and react very quickly with Reactive Oxygen Species, which are sometimes referred to as ROS for short. These ROS are formed during the simple metabolic process of transforming food into energy, and it is the job of the antioxidant to protect cells from the harmful effects of ROS. These molecules are also produced in the body as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke air pollution, and high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.This type of antioxidant works by stopping the production of ROS that occur when fats are being oxidized. There are a few different chronic diseases that are associated with free radicals and at this moment, scientists are studying whether the ability of Vitamin E to hinder these processes may actually have the capacity to prevent these diseases from occurring in the first place.It is no surprise that Vitamin E also has a connection to immune system fortification given its importance as an antioxidant. However, it also has a link to various other types of metabolic processes including gene expression and cell signaling.Health Benefits Provided By Vitamin E Oil 1300 IU/gThe most important role that Vitamin E has in the body is to keep up the integrity of cellular structure and prevent damage to the skin while also promoting healing of the skin after it has already been damaged. Vitamin E is also revered for its ability to prevent or at least slow down the oxidation process of fats and other types of nutrients.Vitamin E is not only able to protect the skin, but also provides a protective membrane around the eyes, liver, testes, and breast; the parts of the body that are most prone to oxidation.One thing that seems to be true for most antioxidants is that they tend to work well with other antioxidants. This means that when taken in conjunction with Vitamin C, Beta-Carotene, etc., the effects of each antioxidant will actually be magnified.Vitamin E may have a strong effect on the elasticity of the skin, but it also has this same effect on arterial elasticity. This means that blood can flow, free of obstruction, and keep the arteries from being clogged.One particularly threatening aspect of oxidation is its potential to deconstruct and damage DNA, but this troubling aspect can be prevented when Vitamin E is present. 	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/v/i/vitamin-e-oil-1300-iu.gif	BulkSupplements	VEO	VEO	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Vitamins	0.00 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness

224	Potassium Citrate Crystalized Powder	http://www.bulksupplements.com/potassium-citrate.html	15.10	It is common to consume anywhere from 2.5 to 5.8 grams of Potassium per day in a typical diet. In general, the amount of Potassium available in supplements is scaled down, since taking too much at once (especially when taken in capsule form) may cause stomach problems. A standard capsule of Potassium supplement will usually have about 100mg of Potassium, whereas a single banana will have about 500mg. Potassium is extremely important to the body and for those that do not consume enough per day. 	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bagresize_193.jpg	BulkSupplements	POTCIT	POTCIT	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Calcium & Minerals	0.00 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness

226	Potassium Iodate Powder	http://www.bulksupplements.com/potassium-iodate.html	16.18	Iodine is needed in order for the Thyroid glands to function appropriately. These glands control the flow of certain very important hormones throughout the body, and without Iodine, the hormones will be incorrectly produced as Iodine is one of the essential ingredients that goes into these hormones. Far from merely controlling some nondescript hormones, the Thyroid controls metabolism to some extent, aids in the conversion between food and energy, keeps human growth and development in check, and it helps to keep body temperature at normal levels.Not taking the correct amount of Iodine daily may result in Iodine deficiency which can then result in Hyperthyroidism. This causes the Thyroid to grow and expand in trying to keep up with the body’s demand for hormones. This could cause the development of a goiter that will be very visible on the body. Hyperthyroidism symptoms include a reduction in mental capabilities, depression, fatigue, dry or itchy skin, muscle cramps and pains, leg swelling, and heightened cholesterol levels.If this disease continues untreated it may result in puffiness of the eyes, decrease in body temperature, heart rate reduction, general heart issues, and accumulation of fluid in or around the lungs, which can be very dangerous. In its most severe forms, Hyperthyroidism may even lead to a special kind of coma.If a woman has Iodine deficiency while pregnant, this may significantly diminish the mental capabilities of the infant once it is born, along with speech problems, problems with movement, stunted growth, and general apathy (which is never a good sign in children). In essence, Iodine deficiency will lead to mental retardation in children. In fact, Iodine deficiency is generally thought to be one of the most common and preventable causes of brain damage. It can even lead to stillbirth and miscarriage if symptoms are severe in the pregnant women. Should this deficiency be corrected, studies have shown that children are more likely to survive.A general American diet will have the necessary daily values of Iodine to function well, but in developing countries it has been found that about 30% of the population is subject to Iodine deficiency.Health Benefits Provided by Potassium IodatePotassium Iodate is mainly used as a way of supplying the body with much needed Iodine. It is a much more important chemical than most people realize and is quite important for sustaining normal functioning and health. 	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/p/o/potassium_iodate.jpg	BulkSupplements	POTDATE	POTDATE	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Calcium & Minerals	0.00 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness

Alpha-ketoglutarate is important in the Krebs cycle. This is the cycle the body goes through which allows various nutrients, proteins, fats, etc to be converted into H2O and carbon dioxide in order to also create usable energy for the body.Glutamine is stored in the muscles and metabolizing organs until the body is in need of energy. Then it is released and converted into glucose when the body needs it. It is also used to keep alkaline levels balanced and to synthesize both RNA and DNA when needed.Glutamine can be found naturally in a variety of meat and dairy related sources such as fish, eggs, and other meats and dairy (and even some plants that are known to have particularly high levels of protein).Health Benefits Provided by Glutamine AKGGlutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Much of the energy that glutamine is responsible for creating goes on to power the immune system which would not be nearly as effective without the influence of glutamine.Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as glutamic acid by the brain. This then acts as a neurotransmitter. Without glutamine it would be impossible for the muscles to correctly synthesize proteins, thus never increasing in mass as they should. 	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/l/-/l-glutamine_alpha-ketoglutarate_akg_.jpg	BulkSupplements	L-GLU-AKG-100	L-GLU-AKG-100	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Amino Acids	0.22 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness

1104	Zinc L-Aspartate - 5kg Pure Powder	http://www.bulksupplements.com/zinc-l-aspartate-5kg-pure-powder.html	142.71	Aspartic acid is important in the process of transferring minerals directly to cells to be used by them during reactions. It is also useful in producing electrolytes and energy for the body while even reducing oxygen use, making for extended periods of intense exercise.Zinc is useful for a variety of reasons. It is able to keep the immune system healthy, along with the digestive and reproductive systems. It also carries out many other important tasks such as cell reproduction, balancing of hormones, and absorbing vitamins and minerals correctly, not to mention the synthesis of proteins, making this a very important mineral.Zinc supplements are traditionally used as a treatment for Zinc deficiency and also to keep subjects on a path towards normal growth if there are any hormone imbalances preventing someone from developing properly. Those that have below average levels of Zinc will have negative symptoms such as poor night vision, slower healing after sustaining wounds, a reduction in the senses of both smell and taste, and a lack of development in the reproductive organs (if the person is younger or still developing). Reduction of Zinc levels in children can stunt growth, cause greater receptiveness to infection and disease, and inhibit sexual growth. There are around 800,000 deaths per year reported where zinc deficiency was either a direct or indirect cause.In fact, Zinc deficiency is credited with being the fifth highest risk factor id disease development. This is how important Zinc is to the immune system. Some countries have an at risk population of over 70% and even estimates on the lower end report that a quarter of the entire world’s population may be at risk of developing Zinc deficiency.Health Benefits Provided by Zinc L-AspartateZinc itself is an antioxidant and can protect healthy cells in the body from sustaining damage due to free radicals. Zinc is also an important component in many different enzymatic reactions which contribute to the regularity of the body’s development. Operations such as protein synthesis, metabolism of energy, and hormone levels (which in themselves can contribute to a great deal of important bodily growth) are all facilitated by zinc. Specifically, collagen, and vitamin A are both dependent upon zinc for their metabolism. Zinc also affects the ability to taste and smell, the appetite, and the levels of vitamin E found in the blood. Zinc is commonly used to protect the skin, and as an antiseptic.The aspartic acid component of this supplement is particularly useful when combined with zinc because it allows for higher bioavailability and for its gentleness on the gastrointestinal tract making it a preferable form of zinc to take for those with weak stomachs.Like Zinc oxide, zinc aspartate can be found in many different topical creams because it too is useful in maintaining healthy skin. 	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/a/m/amazonbag_50.png	BulkSupplements	ZLA-5KG	ZLA-5KG	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Calcium & Minerals	11.02 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness

1161	Copper Gluconate Anhydrous 1% - 5kg Pure Powder	http://www.bulksupplements.com/copper-gluconate-anhydrous-1-5kg-pure-powder.html	126.54	This mineral can be found in a diverse array of sources including liver, other organs, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seafood, particularly oysters. It passes throughout the various areas of the body via a special protein known as Ceruloplasmin.Copper must be supplemented and must have adequate levels maintained as it is essential in numerous bodily functions which are all necessary in sustaining life and health. Copper deficiency can lead to a whole host of issues. There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as a mode of delivery for Copper, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Aspartate, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few. Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels, as Copper and Zinc can compete for bodily absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.The Gluconic Acid present in this mixture is not corrosive. It has mild effects and is organically derived from sources like fruit, kombucha, wine, and honey. The taste of it can be a bit sour, but this allows it to act as a great complement to wine, or various fruit juices. It is used in foods to help reduce levels of overall acidity and is used in some low grade cleaning products in order to help dissolve mineral buildup.Health Benefits Provided by Copper GluconateAs Copper is the third most abundant mineral found in the human body, it must be present in large quantities in order to maintain generally high levels of health and adequate performance of normal bodily functions including bone growth, and protection of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. To fully make use of the benefits of Iron, Copper is needed, and it is also a necessary component in near 50 other enzymes which must have Copper in order to work. Copper is a nutrient which is needed in the synthesis of Collagen, and Hemoglobin.Copper works in conjunction with Zinc and Vitamin C in order to form proteins which both build up and protect various types of tissue and also add to their flexibility and elasticity, not to mention that it is generally useful in the maintenance of healthy skin and bones, joints, and blood vessels.Copper is an antioxidant which helps to neutralize free radicals that go around threatening to cause damage to healthy cells, and copper is essential in the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a form of energy that the body uses for power.Melanin, a skin pigment that determines the color that the hair, eyes, and skin take on, is also dependent upon large levels of Copper. When the hair begins to gray and the skin begins to grow paler due to the Copper deficiency that occurs during old age, the process may be counteracted somewhat by supplementing this mineral.Copper is a restorative agent that is crucial in helping skin maintain its elasticity and is one of the many active ingredients in most topical creams that can be bought commercially. It is one of the many factors that have an effect on the youthful appearance of the skin.While a person may not be considered deficient if they take less than the normal amount of Copper every day, there are many people that are not making use of the overwhelming list of benefits offered by Copper simply because they do not take enough.

It is inextricably important to many enzymes that assist in the many different metabolic processes of the body. This mineral is commonly taken from a diverse array of sources such as organ meats, various types of seafood, legumes, and nuts.Copper must be supplemented and must have adequate levels maintained as it is essential in many bodily functions to sustain life and health. Copper deficiency can lead to a whole host of issues. There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as an alternative mode of delivery to Copper L-Aspartate, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few. Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels too, as Copper and Zinc can compete for absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.This is one of the reasons that Aspartic Acid is included in this solution because it helps to increase the rate of absorption by the body and makes the system’s usage of copper much more efficient. The Citric Acid cycle which is the key to producing energy within each individual cell is also fueled by Aspartic Acid to some degree.Aspartic Acid is a requirement in every cell in the body for this very reason. It does this by promoting the efficient transfer of electrolytes and minerals between the digestive tract and each cell individually. It can also reduce the oxygen consumption of cells during the metabolic process which allows less energy to be expended in the creation of new energy.Copper Aspartate is a nutritional analog, which means that though it is the product of synthesis, it has been tested to perform its duties as a nutritional supplement at an even higher level of effectiveness than the two or more original elements it was synthesized from. It has better absorption rates, tolerance, bioavailability, and retention than any of the parts it is made up of on their own.How to Spot Copper DeficiencyThere are a few different symptoms characteristic of Copper deficiency including increased levels of blood cholesterol, anemia, high blood pressure, stunted growth, tiredness, discolored or brittle hair, etc. This type of deficiency should never be endured over prolonged periods or it can result in irreversible damage to skeletal structure and even infertility.Luckily, Copper deficiency in humans is rare, but it has been known to happen under the right circumstances. There are other symptoms such as bone fractures, low body temperature, increased susceptibility to viruses and sickness, irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, and even birth defects. Copper deficiency can also be an inherited characteristic though this too, is very rare. This is known otherwise as Menke’s disease and causes afflicted infants to be unable to appropriately or effectively absorb Copper. If you think a child may have this condition it must be taken to a doctor immediately to diagnose as this condition needs to be treated early on in life.Health Benefits Provided By Copper L-Aspartate 1%As Copper is the third most abundant mineral found in the human body, it is necessary to be present in large quantities in order to maintain generally high levels of health and adequate performance of normal bodily functions including bone growth, and protection of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems.

Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels too, as Copper and Zinc can compete for absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.This is one of the reasons that Aspartic Acid is included in this solution because it helps to increase the rate of absorption by the body and makes the system’s usage of copper much more efficient. The Citric Acid cycle which is the key to producing energy within each individual cell is also fueled by Aspartic Acid to some degree.Aspartic Acid is a requirement in every cell in the body for this very reason. It does this by promoting the efficient transfer of electrolytes and minerals between the digestive tract and each cell individually. It can also reduce the oxygen consumption of cells during the metabolic process which allows less energy to be expended in the creation of new energy.Copper Aspartate is a nutritional analog, which means that though it is the product of synthesis, it has been tested to perform its duties as a nutritional supplement at an even higher level of effectiveness than the two or more original elements it was synthesized from. It has better absorption rates, tolerance, bioavailability, and retention than any of the parts it is made up of on their own.How to Spot Copper DeficiencyThere are a few different symptoms characteristic of Copper deficiency including increased levels of blood cholesterol, anemia, high blood pressure, stunted growth, tiredness, discolored or brittle hair, etc. This type of deficiency should never be endured over prolonged periods or it can result in irreversible damage to skeletal structure and even infertility.Luckily, Copper deficiency in humans is rare, but it has been known to happen under the right circumstances. There are other symptoms such as bone fractures, low body temperature, increased susceptibility to viruses and sickness, irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, and even birth defects. Copper deficiency can also be an inherited characteristic though this too, is very rare. This is known otherwise as Menke’s disease and causes afflicted infants to be unable to appropriately or effectively absorb Copper. If you think a child may have this condition it must be taken to a doctor immediately to diagnose as this condition needs to be treated early on in life.Health Benefits Provided By Copper L-Aspartate 1%As Copper is the third most abundant mineral found in the human body, it is necessary to be present in large quantities in order to maintain generally high levels of health and adequate performance of normal bodily functions including bone growth, and protection of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. To fully make use of the benefits of Iron, Copper is needed, and it is also a necessary component in near 50 other enzymes which need Copper in order to work. Copper is a nutrient which is needed in the synthesis of Collagen, and Hemoglobin.Copper works in conjunction with Zinc and Vitamin C in order to form proteins which both build and protect various types of tissue and also add to their flexibility and elasticity, not to mention that it is generally useful in the maintenance of healthy skin and bones, joints, and blood vessels.Copper is an antioxidant which helps to neutralize free radicals that go around threatening to cause damage to healthy cells; and it is essential in the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a form of energy that the body uses for power.Melanin, a skin pigment that determines the color that the hair, eyes, and skin take on, is also dependent upon large levels of Copper. When the hair begins to gray and the skin begins to grow paler due to the Copper deficiency that occurs during old age, the process may be counteracted somewhat by supplementing Copper.Copper is a restorative agent that is crucial in helping skin maintain its elasticity and is one of the many active ingredients in most topical creams that can be bought commercially. It is one of the many factors that have an effect on the youthful appearance of the skin.While a person may not be considered deficient if they take less than the normal amount of Copper every day, there are many people that are not making use of the overwhelming list of benefits offered by Copper simply because they do not take enough. This is where supplementation may be useful, particularly for those that consume very much alcohol. 	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/c/o/copper_l-aspartate_1_.jpg	BulkSupplements	COP-L-A-25KG	COP-L-A-25KG	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Category > Calcium & Minerals	55.12 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness

2008	Phenibut - 100g Pure Powder	http://www.bulksupplements.com/phenibut-100g-pure-powder.html	29.16	Phenibut was discovered in Russia by scientists who were looking for an alternative tranquilizing drug for cosmonauts to prevent anxiety, stress and panic without causing drowsiness. Although the traditional sedatives still assert their efficacy in relieving stress and anxiety and panic, they make the cosmonauts drowsy which are not acceptable to them as they need to stay awake while traveling in space. Phenibut became their drug of choice and was in fact made part of the cosmonaut's kit in one of their space missions.Phenibut is obtained from Gamma Amino Butyric Acid or GABA, a major neurotransmitter in the body. The only difference these two chemical compounds have is Phenibut contains a phenyl ring that has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier easily penetrating the brain in a matter of minutes.Phenibut, whose name comes from ß-Phenyl-?-aminobutyric acid, also has the ability to relieve insomnia symptoms and to reduce stress.HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY PHENIBUTPhenibut relieves anxiety and panic. The calming and tranquilizing effect of Phenibut has been lauded and acclaimed by users in their favorable reviews in online forums. These properties and its added attribute of preventing drowsiness made it the drug of choice of cosmonauts in a space mission launched by Russia in the 60's.Phenibut enhances the effects of sleeping pills, sedatives and narcotics. Phenibut has the ability to potentiate or make these drugs more potent and effective to users.  	http://www.bulksupplements.com/media/catalog/product/p/h/phenibut.jpg	BulkSupplements	PNBT-100	PNBT-100	in stock	BulkSupplements > Products by Goal > Mental Wellness	0.22 kilograms	new	Health & Wellness
