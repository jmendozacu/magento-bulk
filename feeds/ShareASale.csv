Alpha-ketoglutarate is important in the Krebs cycle. This is the cycle the body goes through which allows various nutrients, proteins, fats, etc to be converted into H2O and carbon dioxide in order to also create usable energy for the body.Glutamine is stored in the muscles and metabolizing organs until the body is in need of energy. Then it is released and converted into glucose when the body needs it. It is also used to keep alkaline levels balanced and to synthesize both RNA and DNA when needed.Glutamine can be found naturally in a variety of meat and dairy related sources such as fish, eggs, and other meats and dairy (and even some plants that are known to have particularly high levels of protein).Health Benefits Provided by Glutamine AKGGlutamine is important in building the muscular content of the body especially during periods of intense exercise. It helps to create energy for the body and also promotes increased cognitive functioning. Not only that, but it helps control blood sugar levels, protein levels, and assists in the creation of new cells to line the intestinal tract which help further in the creation of energy. Much of the energy that glutamine is responsible for creating goes on to power the immune system which would not be nearly as effective without the influence of glutamine.Glutamine can be converted into another acid known as glutamic acid by the brain. This then acts as a neurotransmitter. Without glutamine it would be impossible for the muscles to correctly synthesize proteins, thus never increasing in mass as they should.","","soldout","53326","","","","","","BulkSupplements","","","","This supplement is a combination between glutamine and alpha-ketoglutarate, a chemical derived from glutaric acid.

It is also useful in producing electrolytes and energy for the body while even reducing oxygen use, making for extended periods of intense exercise.Zinc is useful for a variety of reasons. It is able to keep the immune system healthy, along with the digestive and reproductive systems. It also carries out many other important tasks such as cell reproduction, balancing of hormones, and absorbing vitamins and minerals correctly, not to mention the synthesis of proteins, making this a very important mineral.Zinc supplements are traditionally used as a treatment for Zinc deficiency and also to keep subjects on a path towards normal growth if there are any hormone imbalances preventing someone from developing properly. Those that have below average levels of Zinc will have negative symptoms such as poor night vision, slower healing after sustaining wounds, a reduction in the senses of both smell and taste, and a lack of development in the reproductive organs (if the person is younger or still developing). Reduction of Zinc levels in children can stunt growth, cause greater receptiveness to infection and disease, and inhibit sexual growth.

It passes throughout the various areas of the body via a special protein known as Ceruloplasmin.Copper must be supplemented and must have adequate levels maintained as it is essential in numerous bodily functions which are all necessary in sustaining life and health. Copper deficiency can lead to a whole host of issues. There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as a mode of delivery for Copper, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Aspartate, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few. Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels, as Copper and Zinc can compete for bodily absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.The Gluconic Acid present in this mixture is not corrosive. It has mild effects and is organically derived from sources like fruit, kombucha, wine, and honey. The taste of it can be a bit sour, but this allows it to act as a great complement to wine, or various fruit juices. It is used in foods to help reduce levels of overall acidity and is used in some low grade cleaning products in order to help dissolve mineral buildup.Health Benefits Provided by Copper GluconateAs Copper is the third most abundant mineral found in the human body, it must be present in large quantities in order to maintain generally high levels of health and adequate performance of normal bodily functions including bone growth, and protection of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. To fully make use of the benefits of Iron, Copper is needed, and it is also a necessary component in near 50 other enzymes which must have Copper in order to work. Copper is a nutrient which is needed in the synthesis of Collagen, and Hemoglobin.Copper works in conjunction with Zinc and Vitamin C in order to form proteins which both build up and protect various types of tissue and also add to their flexibility and elasticity, not to mention that it is generally useful in the maintenance of healthy skin and bones, joints, and blood vessels.Copper is an antioxidant which helps to neutralize free radicals that go around threatening to cause damage to healthy cells, and copper is essential in the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a form of energy that the body uses for power.Melanin, a skin pigment that determines the color that the hair, eyes, and skin take on, is also dependent upon large levels of Copper. When the hair begins to gray and the skin begins to grow paler due to the Copper deficiency that occurs during old age, the process may be counteracted somewhat by supplementing this mineral.Copper is a restorative agent that is crucial in helping skin maintain its elasticity and is one of the many active ingredients in most topical creams that can be bought commercially. It is one of the many factors that have an effect on the youthful appearance of the skin.While a person may not be considered deficient if they take less than the normal amount of Copper every day, there are many people that are not making use of the overwhelming list of benefits offered by Copper simply because they do not take enough. This is where supplementation may be useful, particularly for those that consume very much alcohol.","","soldout","53326","","","","","","BulkSupplements","","","","Copper Gluconate is a derivative of both Copper Carbonate and Gluconic acid, with a Mannitol carrier added to bring the level of elemental Copper down to 1% so that it is fit for public consumption.

There are a few different supplement forms that Copper is present in as a mode of delivery for Copper, including Cupric Oxide, Copper Aspartate, Copper Citrate and Copper Sulfate just to name a few. Those that have a Zinc rich diet should be especially wary of their Copper levels, as Copper and Zinc can compete for bodily absorption. This means that a diet that has too much of one mineral will have drastically low levels of the other. The key is to find a balance between the two.The Gluconic Acid present in this mixture is not corrosive. It has mild effects and is organically derived from sources like fruit, kombucha, wine, and honey. The taste of it can be a bit sour, but this allows it to act as a great complement to wine, or various fruit juices. It is used in foods to help reduce levels of overall acidity and is used in some low grade cleaning products in order to help dissolve mineral buildup.Health Benefits Provided by Copper GluconateAs Copper is the third most abundant mineral found in the human body, it must be present in large quantities in order to maintain generally high levels of health and adequate performance of normal bodily functions including bone growth, and protection of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. To fully make use of the benefits of Iron, Copper is needed, and it is also a necessary component in near 50 other enzymes which must have Copper in order to work. Copper is a nutrient which is needed in the synthesis of Collagen, and Hemoglobin.Copper works in conjunction with Zinc and Vitamin C in order to form proteins which both build up and protect various types of tissue and also add to their flexibility and elasticity, not to mention that it is generally useful in the maintenance of healthy skin and bones, joints, and blood vessels.Copper is an antioxidant which helps to neutralize free radicals that go around threatening to cause damage to healthy cells, and copper is essential in the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate, which is a form of energy that the body uses for power.Melanin, a skin pigment that determines the color that the hair, eyes, and skin take on, is also dependent upon large levels of Copper. When the hair begins to gray and the skin begins to grow paler due to the Copper deficiency that occurs during old age, the process may be counteracted somewhat by supplementing this mineral.Copper is a restorative agent that is crucial in helping skin maintain its elasticity and is one of the many active ingredients in most topical creams that can be bought commercially. It is one of the many factors that have an effect on the youthful appearance of the skin.While a person may not be considered deficient if they take less than the normal amount of Copper every day, there are many people that are not making use of the overwhelming list of benefits offered by Copper simply because they do not take enough. This is where supplementation may be useful, particularly for those that consume very much alcohol.","","soldout","53326","","","","","","BulkSupplements","","","","Copper Gluconate is a derivative of both Copper Carbonate and Gluconic acid, with a Mannitol carrier added to bring the level of elemental Copper down to 1% so that it is fit for public consumption. It exists to make sure there is always and abundant amount of Copper in the body, which is necessary to preserve correct system functions. Copper is not only essential for humans but for all living organisms, including plants, due to its presence in many different enzymes which all assist in many vital processes in the human body.","","849720002051","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Citric Acid cycle which is the key to producing energy within each individual cell is also fueled by Aspartic Acid to some degree.Aspartic Acid is a requirement in every cell in the body for this very reason. It does this by promoting the efficient transfer of electrolytes and minerals between the digestive tract and each cell individually. It can also reduce the oxygen consumption of cells during the metabolic process which allows less energy to be expended in the creation of new energy.Copper Aspartate is a nutritional analog, which means that though it is the product of synthesis, it has been tested to perform its duties as a nutritional supplement at an even higher level of effectiveness than the two or more original elements it was synthesized from. It has better absorption rates, tolerance, bioavailability, and retention than any of the parts it is made up of on their own.How to Spot Copper DeficiencyThere are a few different symptoms characteristic of Copper deficiency including increased levels of blood cholesterol, anemia, high blood pressure, stunted growth, tiredness, discolored or brittle hair, etc. This type of deficiency should never be endured over prolonged periods or it can result in irreversible damage to skeletal structure and even infertility.Luckily, Copper deficiency in humans is rare, but it has been known to happen under the right circumstances. There are other symptoms such as bone fractures, low body temperature, increased susceptibility to viruses and sickness, irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, and even birth defects. Copper deficiency can also be an inherited characteristic though this too, is very rare. This is known otherwise as Menke’s disease and causes afflicted infants to be unable to appropriately or effectively absorb Copper.
