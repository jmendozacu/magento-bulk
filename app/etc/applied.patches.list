/*
As the previous versions of the patches were manually applied, we had to continue applying the later patches manually as the .sh was failing to be applied via ssh or bash
When .sh patch file is applied via ssh or bash or using php, this file is automatically generated. 
However, for our case, we are just generating this with only the tag lines because the third party extensions checks whether the patches are installed or not from this file.
